         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

How, and after what manner, upon what terms, and by what degrees, he hath deſign'd the accompliſhment and execution thereof.</p>
            <p>For the former, that great Secretary of Heaven, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle<note place="margin">Sect. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> gives a briefe deſcription of it, <hi>1 Cor. 15. 28. And when all things ſhall be ſubdued unto him, then ſhall the Son alſo himſelfe be ſubject unto him, who hath put all things under him, that GOD MAY BE ALL IN ALL.</hi> God hath alwayes from the beginning, been the ſoveraigne and chiefe Good, in, <hi>i.</hi> unto, or among his Saints: but he never was, nor will be, their onely or alone good, untill he ſhall cauſe all diſpenſations of himſelfe unto them whatſoever, by means, or things inferior to himſelfe, how excellent or glorious ſoever, to ceaſe; and vouchſafe to be himſelf, the alone, and onely diſpenſer of himſelf unto them; In which caſe, he ſhall be <hi>ALL IN ALL.</hi> As long as meats or drinks, ſilver or gold, houſes or lands, friends, or other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, Magiſtrates, or Miniſters, Bibles, or other good books,
<pb facs="tcp:159924:3"/>
yea as long as habits of Grace and Holineſſe, yea as long as Jeſus Chriſt himſelf as Mediator, ſhall be any thing at all unto the Saints, any waies neceſſary, any waies uſefull; God ſhall not, cannot be <hi>ALL IN ALL</hi> unto them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we ſee in the Scripture recited, that Jeſus Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who is here called, <hi>the Son,</hi> who hath made way, as it were at a diſtance, for the advancement of his Saints to this height of bleſſedneſſe and glory which wee ſpeake of, by a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious acceptance, and faithfull performance of the Great Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a Mediator; muſt yet make further way for it, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſting himſelf of that very Office, by which, he did not onely lay the foundations thereof, but ſhall further bring the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to the very dore and entrance of the poſſeſsion; where himſelf yet ſtands, yea and ſhall ſtand, untill the fulneſſe of time appointed by the Father for the Saints entrance, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance into it, and then he ſhall, and will with unſpeakea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble gladneſſe and joy, give place unto his Fathers counſell concerning that tranſcendent bleſſedneſſe of his Saints. For this (doubtleſſe) is that which the Apoſtle meaneth, when he ſaith, <hi>that when all things ſhall be ſubdued unto him, then ſhall the SON alſo himſelf be SUBJECT unto him, who put all things under him.</hi> By that <hi>SUBJEC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION,</hi> which the Son ſhall now exhibit and yeeld unto God the Father, is cleerly meant, his ſubmiſsion unto the counſell of his will, concerning the reſignation of the Mediatory dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie and office; and that preciſely for this end and purpoſe, (as the Apoſtle himſelf expreſſeth it) <hi>that God may be ALL IN ALL;</hi> which counſell of God, cannot (as hath been ſaid) take place, whilſt Jeſus Chriſt acteth, or executeth any thing at all for the benefit of the Saints, as Mediator. And in as much as this ſubmiſsion of Chriſt, though it be unto his Father, and his counſell, yet is for his Saints ſake, I meane, to make way for their higheſt exaltation; and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

that reſpect, he is and will be herein ſerviceable unto them; it may (poſsibly) be the meaning and fulfilling of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>Luk. 12. 37.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the latter; that condition of the Saints ſpoken of,<note place="margin">Sect. 3.</note> wherein <hi>God ſhall be ALL IN ALL,</hi> as it is, and muſt of neceſsitie be, abſolutely the beſt and richeſt in bleſſedneſſe of being; ſo hath God, according to his uſuall method in ſuch caſes, aſsigned unto it, the hindmoſt and laſt place amongſt all the ſeverall eſtates and conditions, thorough which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to carry his Saints (which I conceive to be more, and more various, then generally is thought, or beleeved) but this being the moſt abſolute and perfect condition, whereof the creature is capable, hath the dayes of eternitie ſet out for the continuance of it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, as we know it is natures method and manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding,<note place="margin">Sect. 4.</note> to begin with what is leſſe perfect, and to goe forward to that which is more; ſo is it the method likewiſe of the God of nature, to be ſtill upon the riſing hand, more liberall and gracious in his ſucceeding, then in his ante-ceding diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. <hi>Howbeit,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>that was not firſt, which is ſpirituall, but that which is naturall: and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that which is ſpirituall. The firſt man is of the earth, earthy: the ſecond man is the Lord from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 46, 47.</note>.</hi> And elswhere: <hi>For we know in part, and prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in part.

And this is that which we have deſcribed (with the Apoſtle) to be when himſelf will be <hi>ALL IN ALL,</hi> diſpenſer, diſpenſation, and diſpenſed, unto all his Saints.</p>
            <p>Againe, 2. that this <hi>Diſpenſation,</hi> wherein God will<note place="margin">Sect. 5.</note>
               <pb facs="tcp:159924:4"/>
thus be <hi>ALL IN ALL,</hi> muſt needs be the moſt abſolute and perfect, and the creature enjoy the greateſt bleſſedneſſe of all other under it, is evident from hence. After what manner ſoever, or in what kinde ſoever, or to what degree ſoever, he ſhall pleaſe to diſpence or communicate himſelf unto men, by the interveniency or mediation of what creature, or creatures ſoever, there muſt of neceſsitie be found ſome reliſh or taſte (at leaſt) of the weakneſſe or defectibilitie of the creature, in the diſpenſation, and conſequently it cannot be ſo rich and full, as if no created being whatſoever had to doe, little or much in it, but onely God himſelfe. Where there is no defect in the efficient, this being ſimply one, there can be no defect in the effect, at leaſt not from any deficiency in that action, by which it is produced; as on the contrary, where there is a juncto of efficients, whether two or more, all joyning and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring to the production of one and the ſame effect, if there be any one of them defective and weake (as ſecond, or created efficients evermore are, in reſpect of the firſt, or increated) the prints or footſteps of this weakneſſe muſt of neceſsitie be found in the effect. It is a true obſervation, that ſuch, whether actions, or ſubſtances, which received their beings, by way of miracle, or of immediate efficiencie from God; have ever been more excellent and perfect in their reſpective kinds, then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the ſame kinde with them, in the production whereof, naturall or ſecond cauſes have had their intereſts, and coope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. Never were the walls of any Citie ſo diſmantled or mall'd by any engine of warre, or battery of Cannon whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, as the walls of <hi>Jericho</hi> were upon the blowing of the trumpets of Rammes horns. <hi>Et cecidit murus ſub ſe</hi> (ſaith the Text) i. <hi>and the wall fell downe beneath it ſelfe <note n="a" place="margin">Joſh. 6. 20.</note>:</hi> That is (as <hi>Lavater</hi> interprets) <hi>abſorptus eſt in terram,</hi> was ſwallowed down into the earth. In like maner, <hi>Naamans</hi> cure of his leproſie by waſhing in <hi>Jordan,</hi> was ſo abſolute and

And from this obſervation, probably aroſe that idiome or proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of ſpeech among the <hi>Jewes,</hi> to ſignifie the excellencie of things in their kinds, by calling them the things of God; as faire and goodly Cedars, are called <hi>(Pſal. 80. 10.) the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dars of God.</hi> So great and high mountains, <hi>the mountains of God,</hi> Pſal. 36. 6.

The weake thoughts and expreſsions of child-hood, doe much commend
<pb facs="tcp:159924:5"/>
the ſolid wiſdome and diſcourſe of men. And generally, that which is imperfect, uſhereth in perfection with the greater ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation and triumph. God, if ſo it had ſeemed good in the eyes of his wiſdome, might have begun with his Saints, where now he purpoſeth to end; and never have ſuffered any created being to have interpoſed, or been any thing at all unto them: he might have been unto them, not onely <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> but alſo, <hi>Beta, Gamma, Delta,</hi> and all the letters of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phabet beſides, from the firſt to the laſt. But then <hi>Iſrael</hi> had wanted <hi>ſowre herbs,</hi> wherewith to eat the Paſchall Lamb: and the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> himſelf had wanted thoſe large contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions, which the weakneſſe and imperfections, and unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable deportments of the creature in her ſubminiſtrations unto his Saints, have already, and further will, caſt in to the treaſury of his glory. It is the beſt and higheſt improvement of the ſowreneſſe of the creature, to commend the ſweetneſſe of God; and of the weakneſſe of the creature, to advance, quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, inlarge, and raiſe our apprehenſions in the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſtrength, fulneſſe and perfection of God. It is ſaid of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> a wiſe and politique Prince, that he adopted <hi>Tiberius,</hi> a man of a rugged and unpleaſanc diſpoſition, to ſucceed him in the Empire, for this end, <hi>Ut ipſe quando<expan>

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:159924:5"/>Amongst many others, there are two great Ordinances<note place="margin">Sect. 7.</note> and Diſpenſations, by which the good pleaſure of God is, to communicate of himſelfe, his goodneſſe, and love unto his Saints, during the preſent ſtate and condition of things in the world; the one is that of the Miniſtery of his Word; the other, of Civill Magiſtracie; the one intended for their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling out of this preſent world, in reſpect of their hearts and wayes, and for the fitting of them for their future glory; the other, for their protection in this preſent world, that under the ſhadow of it, they <hi>may lead a quiet and peaceable life, in all godlineſſe and honeſtie<note n="a" place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 2.</note>.</hi> And though God ſometimes ſaid unto <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that he both <hi>gave them a King in his anger,</hi> and alſo <hi>took him away in his wrath<note n="b" place="margin">Hoſ. 13. 11.</note>;</hi> yet the contrary may be truly affirmed of his intentions in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving both thoſe Ordinances we ſpake of, unto the world: He gave both the one &amp; the other, as well Magiſtracy, as Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, and againe, this, as well as that, in love; yea, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues them in love; and in time, will take them away too in love unto his Saints. Firſt, that God gave them both in love, is evident, from the nature and proper tendency of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective offices and imployments, as God himſelf hath decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them. Concerning the Magiſtrate, the Holy-Ghoſt ſaith, That <hi>he is the Miniſter of God to thee for good<note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 13. 4.</note>;</hi> and that he <hi>attends continually upon this very thing<note n="d" place="margin">Verſ. 6.</note>; i.</hi> the doing of thee good in his place and office; with many other things of like conſideration elswhere, relating unto the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of this Ordinance. Againe, concerning the miniſterie of the Word, it is ſaid to have been given by Chriſt, <hi>for the perfecting of the Saints, for the edifying of the body of Chriſt, till wee all come in the unitie of the Faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt<note n="e" place="margin">Epheſ. 4. 12, 13.</note>.</hi> So that there i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:159924:6"/>
one, as the other, were given by God in love, unto the world, and in ſpeciall manner unto the Saints.</p>
            <p>Againe, 2. there is as little queſtion to be made, but that<note place="margin">Sect. 8.</note> they are in love alſo unto the Saints, continued, and kept on foot by God in the world. This appears, partly by the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of thoſe reſpective Lawes of ingagement (which were lately mentioned) upon both the one, and the other, God not having reverſed, nor intending to reverſe the leaſt jot or tit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in either, whilſt he intends to continue the Ordinances themſelves; partly alſo from hence, becauſe, though theſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, as well the one as the other, may very poſsibly, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the undue qualifications of the perſons in whom they ſhall be veſted, and by whom, executed, prove now and then very trouble ſome and afflictive unto the Saints; yet they can hardly fall into ſuch hands, ſo unworthy or vile, but that the communitie (at leaſt) of the Saints, though not all particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, will be in a better condition by the means of them, then they would be without them, untill the Great wheele of the world be turn'd round, and that part of it which hath been below hitherto, and is like yet to be lower then it hath been, for a ſeaſon, be brought to ſtand above.</p>
            <p>Thirdly (and laſtly) that God will in love alſo unto his<note place="margin">Sect. 9.</note> Saints, aboliſh and take away both the one and the other of the ſaid Diſpenſations, is yet more evident (if more may be) then either of the former. Becauſe, 1. the native intentions of God in the giving of them, will be ſo farre perverted by thoſe, into whoſe hands they will in proceſſe of time come, that no man looking upon them in their execution and manage, will be able to ſay, theſe are Ordinances of God. 2. Becauſe, God will make the abolition and diſſolution of theſe, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction and bringing in of other Diſpenſations, far more rich, and bleſſed, and deſireable, in their ſtead. The former of theſe reaſons, with the concluſion it ſelfe, is plainly aſſerted
<pb facs="tcp:159924:6"/>
and laid down by the Apoſtle. <hi>Then cometh the end, when he ſhall have delivered up the Kingdome unto God, even the Father, when he ſhall have put downe all rule</hi>

The latter reaſon, is held forth unto us by <hi>John,</hi> who having firſt deſcribed, and taken a perfect ſurvey of that <hi>Holy Citie, new Jeruſalem, which came downe from God out of Heaven,</hi> (by which, according to the ſenſe almoſt of all Expoſitors, is meant the Church of Chriſt in her Great and Bleſſed Reformation) towards the cloſe of his diſcourſe upon this ſubject, he tells us what he miſſed, and did not ſee amongst all the glorious or naments and rarities of this Citie, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>Temple,</hi> meaning, a materiall <hi>Temple,</hi> or a <hi>Temple</hi> properly ſo called. <hi>And I ſaw</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>no Temple therein.</hi> But becauſe it might ſeeme ſtrange that ſuch an holy Citie as this ſhould be without a <hi>Temple</hi> in it; he therefore explains himſelfe of what kinde of <hi>Temple</hi> he ſpake, when he ſaid, he ſaw no <hi>Temple</hi> in it, by ſhewing what manner of <hi>Temple</hi> there was in it notwithſtanding. <hi>FOR</hi> (ſaith be) <hi>the Lord God All-mightie, and the Lamb, are the Temple thereof.</hi> By this cauſall particle, <hi>FOR,</hi> he cleerly implies, that had it not been, that <hi>the Lord God All-mightie, and the Lamb (i.</hi> by the figure, <hi>Hendiadis,</hi> elswhere uſ'd in this booke) <hi>the Lord God almightie,</hi> in, and by the Lamb, <hi>[Chriſt]</hi> vouch ſafed to become the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple thereof,</hi> i. to performe the worke of the Miniſtery unto

            <p>
               <hi>Reader,</hi> I have drawne up this briefe Diſcourſe in this
<pb facs="tcp:159924:7"/>
place, chiefly to give unto thee, and to all the world, a plaine and ingenuous account, what my judgement and thoughts are about Civill Magiſtracie; becauſe I have been (moſt undu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and untruly, and in the very face of many demonſtrations to the contrary, both <hi>reall,</hi> and <hi>nominall</hi>) repreſented as an enemy to it; and particularly by the Authors of that <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication,</hi> which, not thorough any ſubſtance or weight in it ſelfe, but by reaſon of the weakneſſe of others giving a loud teſtimony of ſtrength unto it, occaſioned the following Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. I cleerly and freely acknowledge it to be an Ordinance of God; yea, an Ordinance of very gracious intentions unto men, in him who is the Author and founder of it. And though I conceive it to be a very tender Ordinance, extremely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to take ſoyle, and apt to loſe the grace and beautie of it, when it comes to be handled by men; yet when it doth fall into cleane and tender hands, it makes the <hi>Sunne</hi> aſhamed, and the <hi>Moone</hi> abaſhed, at the brightneſſe, beautie, and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of it. Yea I conceive it to be an ordinance of that grand import and concernment unto the world, during the preſent ſtate of perſons and things in it, that it cannot lightly fall into hands ſo farre unſanctified, or unworthy the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and manage; but that it will doe more then beare its own charges, more then ballance the inconveniences, which ſhall at any time attend the execution of it. I looke upon it, as the onely preventive appointed by God to keepe the world from falling foule upon it ſelf, and being deſtroyed by its own hands. And as I judge thoſe very impolitique Chriſtians, and as men <hi>rejecting the counſell of God</hi> (for their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall good) <hi>againſt themſelves,</hi> who by caſting off Church-Ordinances by Paſtors and Teachers, ſeeme to catch at the ſpirituall priviledge of <hi>new Jeruſalem,</hi> before it be <hi>come downe from Heaven;</hi> ſo doe I judge thoſe very unchriſtian Politioians, and as men <hi>rejecting the counſell of God</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:159924:8"/>
likewiſe (for their politique and civill good) <hi>againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> who thinke they ſhould, or might anticipate that other great priviledge of this Heavenly Citie, which wee ſpake of, (freedome from Magiſtracie,) by a preſent ejecting of this Ordinance out of the world. Alas! though <hi>God</hi> (as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle informeth us) hath provided <hi>better things for us</hi> who live under the Goſpel, then he did for his people under the Law; yet if they who liv'd under the Law, had caſt off thoſe Leviticall ordinances and obſervations appointed by God for their generation, upon pretence of <hi>weakneſſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitableneſſe</hi> in them, ſaying, that they would not <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God at Jeruſalem,</hi> but onely <hi>in ſpirit and truth;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this was more Evangelicall and perfect; had they not attempted to put God himſelf to rebuke in his diſpenſations, and withall conſulted loſſe and diſadvantage to themſelves and their own ſoules, in their ſpirituall, if not in their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall affaires alſo. Thoſe fruits, which being gathered and eaten in the ſpring of the yeare, whilſt they are yet greene and ſowre, are apt to cauſe diſeaſes, and to prove deſtructive unto health, if not unto life it ſelfe; if let grow upon their trees untill Autumne, or the due ſeaſon of their ripening, may now be gathered and eaten, not onely without danger, but with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light alſo, &amp; advancement of health. In like manner, though the dayes be acoming, when deliverance from that, both Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie and Magiſtracie, which now ſupport and accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date the Chriſtian world, though with a mixture of many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accommodations in both, will be as a reſurrection from death unto life, unto the Saints; yet to attempt a deliverance from either, untill <hi>the Lord God Allmightie, and the Lamb</hi> ſhall vouchſafe to intereſſe themſelves in ſuch diſpenſations, which ſhall eminently be both the one and the other (as wee heard) muſt needs be as <hi>a covering of the Sunne with ſackcloath, and a turning of the Moone into bloud,</hi> I

Firſt, ſhee <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth, that this paſſage of Providence, ſpeakes thus much to the Independents, and to the Kingdome, that the Independents are for warres, deſirous of warres, and thirſt for a new warre with Scotland,</hi> &amp;c. Secondly, that <hi>the warres which they would have, and occaſion, ſhall prove their ruine, the means to overthrow all their Conventicles,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and caſt them out of England for ever; as the Biſhops and their faction were greedy
<pb facs="tcp:159924:12"/>
for a warre againſt the Scots, to ſupport their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> &amp;c. But, <hi>Reader,</hi> if the Author of <hi>Gangrena,</hi> were <hi>a man in any reputation for wiſdome or honour,</hi> here is a <hi>dead flie</hi> that would <hi>cauſe his oyntme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to ſend forth a ſtinking ſavour for ever. This paſſage of Providence,</hi> (as this Son of ſhame and inconſiderateneſſe calleth it) this <hi>perfect ſound of a March, beaten on an inviſible Drum,</hi> &amp;c. aſſerted with as much <hi>confidence,</hi> as pen could well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe, and by the tenor whereof this falſe Prophet and Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of follies, undertakes to know and to declare, the ſecret thoughts and intentions both of God and men, was nothing elſe (as many that were preſent when this Tragi-Comedie was acted, and ſome of them Presbyterians; yea ſome, that ſaw the inviſible <hi>Drummer,</hi> doe report,) but a dog ſcratching his eare, and with his foot, upon every advance thereof to ſcratch, beating the ſounding ſide of the pew wherein he was. And as for the greateſt part of thoſe circumſtances, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the maine body of this notorious—is dreſt and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, as the <hi>ſound of the March was heard as coming into the Chappell, and then as going up all along the Ile,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that Mr. Eaton and the people were terrified with it; that Mr. Eaton gave over preaching, and fell to praying; that they broke up their exerciſe, becauſe of the March ſtill beating,</hi> &amp;c. All theſe are nothing elſe, but ſparks of that unhallowed fire, which burnes in the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ells of <hi>Gangrena's</hi> race, and conſumes the very foundations of ingenuitie and Truth in High-Presbyterian Spirits. If <hi>Gangrena</hi> her ſelfe had a forehead made of any other met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, then braſſe, or yron, any ſence or touch of ingenuitie, or true honour, ſhe would bind her face in the duſt, and keep her ſin and ſhame company in darkneſſe for one ſeven yeares, at leaſt, after ſuch a ſhameleſſe and prodigious abuſe of the world and her ſelf, as this. But (as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith) <hi>one tree, though

But certainly <hi>it will be more tolerable</hi> for the Golden, then for the Leaden Legend, <hi>in the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Firſt, becauſe the Golden Legend belies onely, or for the moſt part, Saints of her own, or her friends making; and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, belies them ſtill on the right hand; whereas our Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Legend, advances onely ſtories on the left hand; and with theſe, diſhonours, either only, or for the moſt part, Saints made ſuch by God.

There are of this Generation, who (it ſeemes,) having a facultie to make verball victories of reall diſaſters, impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunely applaud their Champions (which were foure, if not five to two) and congratulate their great ſucceſſe in a diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation lately held in <hi>Chriſt-Church-Pariſh,</hi> about the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, not ſo much of the payment, as of the demand, of tithes by the Miniſter. By meanes of which diſpute, though there was nothing ſaid but had <hi>tantum</hi> for <hi>quantum,</hi> anſwer for argument in full returne; not ſo much as any one man, that I can heare of, who came ſcrupul'd in the point, that went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſatisfied, (except it were in the juſtneſſe of the ground of his ſcruple and of the unlawfulneſſe of that, which could not by all that was there ſaid be juſtified) yet ſome of the partie, as if they were bound by their Covenant to provide, <hi>perfas, &amp; nefas,</hi> that <hi>Presbyterians</hi> may <hi>in all things have the preheminence,</hi> or were acted by that Maxime of the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory<note place="margin">Quod non po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt fieri per viam juſticiae, fiat per modu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> expedientiae.</note> of <hi>Rome, That which cannot be done in a way of right, let it be done by way of expediency;</hi> have (as I underſtand from ſeverall hands,) fill'd the Citie with this

vapour, that Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> and his Colleague in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, had their mouths ſtopt, and were not able to anſwer a word to thoſe who oppoſed them. I was once under ſome thoughts, of penning and publiſhing the contents of the ſaid Diſputation, looking for this puffe of winde from that point of the Compaſſe, from whence it now bloweth; and may yet, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the occaſion given, do it, if I could cleere my hands of ſome other work, which as yet ſticks cloſe to them. In the mean time <hi>(Reader,)</hi> thou maiſt pleaſe to underſtand, that there were onely two arguments produc'd, and inſiſted upon, by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons of Tithes; which (I ſpeak unfeignedly) being thoroughly examin'd and look'd into, are of no more ſtrength to carry the cauſe of demanding tiths, then a couple of ſilly Lambs yok'd in a teame, are able to draw a Weſtern waine of twentie hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred weight, thorough the deepeſt waies, or up the ſteepeſt hils. I had not touch'd upon this ſtring, had not others plaid too loud upon the baſe.</p>
            <p>One thing (amongſt many others) ſeemes very unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble<note place="margin">Sect. 17.</note> unto me in the way of <hi>High Presbyterie,</hi> which I judge worthy advertiſement in this place. The Sons of this judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment &amp; way, judge it Chriſtian and meet (as they have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in abundance to doe) mutually to tolerate one another in leſſer differences (as they uſe to call the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) that is, in ſuch diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences about ſuch opinions, which lie off at ſome diſtance from the fundamental Doctrines or Principles of Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, &amp; which are deducible from theſe by proceſſe of rational diſcourſe. And the truth is, that without a reciprocall Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in ſuch differences as theſe, they would hardly ever ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or hang together, or grow into the unitie of a bodie; unleſſe they agreed to caſt lots amongſt them, whoſe judgement ſhould be King, to preſcribe Doctrines and opinions for Lawes unto all his fellows. Now conſidering that the maine Principles, and fundamentall Doctrines of Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, are much more difficult to be comprehended by reaſon, or to be aſſented unto as Truths, then ſuch deductions or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions,
<pb facs="tcp:159924:15"/>
which in an ordinary way of diſcourſe, may be infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from, and reſolved into, their knowne or granted Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; it ſeemes repugnant to all grounds of reaſon and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, that men ſhould have favour in their diſſentings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout theſe, and be judged worthy of death for diſſenting in the other. Penall Lawes are not wont to be enacted amongst men, againſt any ſuch miſcarriages or deficiences in men, which require an excellency in vertue, wiſedome, or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to prevent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but onely againſt ſuch, which the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and knowne principles of reaſon, juſtice, and honeſtie, are ſufficient to reſtraine. It is proper indeed, that Lawes of incouragement, and of rewards, be made to provoke and ſtirre men up to actions of honour, and which are difficult to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, eſpecially ſuch, which are like to be of publique benefit, or ſervice to the State; but not to enact any penaltie againſt thoſe, who ſhall not performe ſuch actions, unleſſe it be the loſſe, or non receiving the reward promiſed by Law to thoſe that ſhall performe them. I have oft heard, of an ancient Law in <hi>England,</hi> by which there was a reward appointed for every man that ſhould kill a Wolfe, but I never heard of any, which impoſed a penaltie upon thoſe who killed none. And if men deſire to inſure all thoſe to the way of <hi>High Presbyterie,</hi> who do not religiouſly, &amp; out of pure conſcience, diſſent in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from it, their only courſe is, to procure ſome Law or Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute to be made, wherein ſome conſiderable reward ſhall be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by way of incouragement to all thoſe that ſhall adhere to this way; onely with this proviſo, (for righteouſneſſe and conſcience ſake) that this reward be not aſsigned unto them out of the due rights and priviledges of thoſe, who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſhall diſſent from them.</p>

For to this day (doubtleſſe) it was never knowne or heard, that men ſhould frame Arguments and Syllogiſmes of their owne, and call their Anſwers unto theſe, Anſwers to the Queſtions of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. When they taught the late Catechiſme of their preſent Church, and asked the child, <hi>What is your Name?</hi> and, <hi>who gave you this Name?</hi> did they teach the child to anſwer, firſt by framing Syllogiſmes out of, or upon the Queſtions; and then, by anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring theſe Syllogiſmes in ſtead of the Queſtions? If they had meant fairely, and nothing but what was upright in the ſight of God and men, in addreſſing themſelves to Anſwer the Queries, theſe being fairely and directly propoſed, why did they fetch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>by the way of the fullers field,</hi> by which <hi>Rabſhekah came againſt Jeruſalem</hi>

Or howſoever, they never made Syllogiſmes, calling their Anſwers to theſe, Anſwers to the Queſtions propoſed unto them by others. Certainly theſe men would not have travelled out of the Kings high-way, but to lie in waite to rob and ſteale from thoſe, who travell honeſtly and peaceably in it: There was (out of all doubt) ſome Clergie-Claſſique fetch, or reach in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture: the men are better husbands of their Syllogiſmes and Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke, then to purſue or hunt after Truth or ſpirituall things with them: theſe they ſtill take, and come by with as much eaſe and expedition, as <hi>Jacob</hi> came by his Veniſon, which he fetchd out <hi>of the ſtock.</hi>

            <p>Firſt then, their Anſwer to their firſt Argument or Syllogiſme,<note place="margin">Sect. 10.</note> fram'd by occaſion of my firſt Querie, is built upon this diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: The <hi>making of ſnares of any of the Doctrines of Chriſt for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the lives of men,</hi> may be taken two wayes; firſt, <hi>for a malitious intention, and formall deſire to take away mens lives: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, for no more but the appointing of the puniſhment of death for ſuch as ſhall WICKEDLY oppoſe any of the Doctrines of Chriſt.</hi> In this latter ſenſe, they conclude it lawfull, yea and neceſſary, to make ſnares of the Doctrines of Chriſt, for the deſtruction of the lives of men, and denie it in the former. But</p>
            <p>Firſt, the Ordinance doth not ſay, who ſhall <hi>WICKEDLY preach, teach, publiſh, any opinion contrary, &amp;c.</hi> but that, <hi>all ſuch who ſhall VVILLINGLY preach, teach, &amp;c. ſhall, without abjuring, ſuffer the paines of death.</hi> Therefore the ſaid Diſtinction is imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, and reacheth not the cauſe in hand. For who with halfe an eye, is not able to ſee a vaſt difference, between preaching, or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing a point, <hi>VVILLINGLY,</hi> and <hi>VVICKEDLY?</hi> when Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Miniſters preach falſe Doctrine, as that tithes, or Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall Government are <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> that it is unlawfull either to ſell or buy Biſhops Lands, that the Parliament is bound to doe as the Aſſembly would have them, that legall preparations are ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and abſolutely neceſſary before Converſion, that men are bound to believe that which they have no reaſon to believe, that Repentance goeth before Faith, that Chriſt ſuffered the torments of Hell, with twenty and ten vaine ſpeculations, and viſions of their owne hearts beſides, wherewith they corrupt and poyſon the Judgements of their ſimple and credulous Auditories, I preſume they doe all this <hi>VVILLINGLY;</hi> but whether they doe it <hi>VVICK<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>EDLY,</hi> or no, let themſelves judge and ſay. But</p>
            <p>Secondly, ſuppoſe the Ordinance had ſaid, <hi>VVICKEDLY,</hi> as the Syllogiſme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s ſpeake; I demand of them what they meane by the word, <hi>VVICKEDLY,</hi> and who ſhall judge and determine of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:159924:25"/>
this modification or aggravation of the offence? Suppoſe a man<note place="margin">Sect. 10.</note> ſhould preach very zealouſly, and with fervency of Spirit againſt any of thoſe Tenets which theſe men call the Doctrines of Chriſt, as againſt the <hi>Jus Divinum,</hi> or lawfulneſſe of tithes, or of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, or the like; will they call this a <hi>preaching VVICKEDLY?</hi> If ſo, then themſelves preach <hi>VVICKEDLY,</hi> as oft as zealouſly. If by <hi>VVICKEDLY,</hi> they meane, obſtinately, or <hi>with obſtinacie</hi> (an expreſſion which the paper called, <hi>The Ordinance,</hi> uſeth) this is to give light by darkneſſe: and I demand, as before, what they meane, by <hi>obſtinately?</hi> For neither doth the Ordinance, nor the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerters of it, (who yet undertake too to be the Interpreters of it, when, and as they pleaſe <note n="a" place="margin">page 1, 2.</note>) declare, or determine any thing at all herein. If by preaching, or publiſhing a Doctrine <hi>obſtinately,</hi> they meane, a preaching it after admonition, or after meanes us'd, yea or after ſufficient meanes us'd (I meane, ſufficient, in the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe that uſe them; yea or of thoſe who are interreſſed in the ſame judgement with thoſe that uſe them) then themſelves, as oft as they preach the point of Infant-Baptiſme, preach <hi>obſtinately,</hi> and conſequently, <hi>VVICKEDLY?</hi> For they have been admoniſhed again and again by the Anti-poedo-baptiſts, both by writing and otherwiſe; who alſo have uſed meanes upon meanes, and thoſe by themſelves and all of their party, judged to be abundantly ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to convince them, of the errour of this Doctrine (for ſo they judge it to be.) So againe, (according to this interpretation of the word) when they preach againſt the lawfulneſſe of ſelling and buying the Biſhops Lands, they preach <hi>obſtinately,</hi> and ſo <hi>VVICK<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>EDLY,</hi> for by the late Ordinance of Parliament publiſhed in that behalfe, they are admoniſhed, yea, and in the Judgement of the Parliament, ſufficiently informed, of the lawfulneſſe of both. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance might be given in twenty points more of like conſideration. If they have any other ſenſe or meaning in the word, <hi>Obſtinately,</hi> which is more crypticall, or myſterious, it is but reaſonable and equall, that it be declared and made knowne; before the lifes or liberties of the Saints, or other men be endangered by it. It is moſt un-chriſtian and repugnant to the law and light of nature it ſelfe, that any ſuch Lawes or Statutes ſhould be made, wherein either the lifes or Liberties of men are touch'd; and yet the ſenſe and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of them, by the ambiguity of the words, wherein they are
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:159924:25"/>
conceived, be of doubtfull interpretation unto thoſe, who are ſo<note place="margin">Sect. 10.</note> deeply concern'd in them. Lawes and Statutes, wherein the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious lives and Liberties of men are concern'd, ought not to be like <hi>Ariſtotles acroamatiques;</hi> concerning which he ſaid, when he had publiſhed them, <hi>edidi, &amp; non edidi. i.</hi> I have publiſhed them, and I have not publiſhed them; meaning, that as he had ſet them forth, few were able to underſtand them: but to be plaine and tranſparent in their ſenſe and meaning; that even perſons of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt capacity may without an Interpreter, ſee to the bottome of them. Or Thirdly, (and laſtly,) if by <hi>VVICKEDLY,</hi> in their diſtinction, they meane, <hi>maliciouſly,</hi> (which the word ſeemes moſt properly to import) I deſire to know of them, whom they will conſtitute or make Judges of this inward and ſoule-miſdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; or what <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, what Symptomes, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or ſignes they will Authorize, as infallibly demonſtrative of this maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie? For it is no wayes Chriſtian or equall, that the Saints (or indeed any other ſort of men) ſhould be deprived of their lives, or precious Liberties, upon what Interpretation of the Law, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Jurie, or the Judge ſhall pleaſe to make. But the caſe and condition of the Saints would be moſt deplorable upon ſuch terms as theſe; in as much as there are very few either Juries, or Judges, but being ſtrangers to the worke of Grace, inwardly hate this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of men; according to that (with many the like) ſaying of the Scriptures: <hi>Marvell not my Brethren, if the world hate you</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">1 Joh. 3. 13.</note>: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto that of our Saviour himſelfe alſo agreeth; <hi>Becauſe ye are not of the world, but I have choſen you of the world, therefore the world ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth you</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Joh. 15. 19.</note>. Now it being the genius or property of this affection of hatred, to deſire and ſeek the deſtruction of that which is hated, (<hi>Quem quiſque odit, periiſſe expetit</hi>) it were moſt ſad with the Saints, if they that hate them, ſhould have the Liberty of interpreting not onely their actions and practiſes, as they pleaſe; but alſo of the Lawes themſelves too, by which theſe are to be judged.</p>
            <p>Thus then it fully appeares, that the Diſtinction, upon which the Syllogizers build their Anſwer to their firſt Syllogiſme, is, by reaſon of the ambiguity and doubtfulneſſe in one of the moſt ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and important terms in it, altogether inſufficient and null; and in exactneſſe of truth, no diſtinction at all; no more, then a diſh, with an hole in the bottome of it, is a diſh, or a man without

a ſoule, a man. Miſerable is the condition of thoſe, whoſe Faith<note place="margin">Sect. 11. 12.</note> muſt be pinn'd upon ſuch ſleeves as theſe.</p>
            <p>There are ſeverall other importune, reaſonleſſe, and falſe aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions<note place="margin">Sect. 11.</note> and ſuppoſitions made to ſupport the ſaid Anſwer and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction. As</p>
            <p>1. <hi>That he that ſhall but inſinuate a reproach upon the Ordinance in ſuch a phraſe as this, of making a ſnare for the destruction of the lives of men, doth with the ſame hand or tongue cast a reproach upon ALL the punitive Juſtice that ever was, or will be in the world</hi>

               </gap> of an inferiour delinquencie in reſpect of them (at leaſt as the tenour of the Hiſtories compared together ſeems to import?) Or what reaſon can theſe irrefragable Doctors give, why the Spirit of God in the Old Teſtament, which is but one and the ſame Spirit with the Spirit of Chriſt in the New, ſhould not be at as much liberty to alter the puniſhments or penalties, as the Ordinances of worſhip appointed in the Old Teſtament, under the New? Are the former ſo much more ſacred then the latter, that though theſe be changed, yet thoſe muſt of neceſſity abide for ever? Is there nothing in that great diſpenſation of God, by which <hi>he ſhooke the Earth alſo, as well as the Heavens</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">Heb. 12. 26.</note>, I meane the ſending of his onely begotten Sonne Jeſus Chriſt in the fleſh into the world? was there no occaſion hereby miniſtred unto God, to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry from his ancient oeconomie of governing his Church and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as much as an alteration or change of ſome externall penalties, amount unto?

            <p>Fourthly, the ſaid Anſwer bluſheth alſo with the red of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, or ſuppoſall: <hi>viz.</hi> that becauſe that <hi>negative expreſſion</hi> of Chriſt mentioned, that <hi>he came not to deſtroy mens lives,</hi> is <hi>not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily an abſolute negation, but rather a preferring of one thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore another;</hi> therefore it is <hi>neceſſarily and abſolutely</hi> a preferring of one thing before another; and the meaning of it <hi>neceſſarily and abſolutely</hi> this, that Chriſt came not onely, or ſo much, to <hi>deſtroy mens lives,</hi> but <hi>to ſave them.</hi> Doth the poſſibility, or non-neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the being of a thing either ſo or ſo, <hi>neceſſarily</hi> and <hi>abſolutely</hi> imply the being of it otherwiſe? This (it ſeemes) is one of the Logick pillars, upon which Presbytery hath built her houſe.</p>
            <p>Fiftly (and laſtly) the Anſwer wee ſpeake of, vaniſheth away, and dieth in the hand of this moſt ſenſeleſſe and importune reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.<note place="margin">Sect. 14.</note> If <hi>Peter by his word ſtruck Ananias and Sapphira dead for their ſacrilegious diſſimulation; and Chriſt himſelfe threaten deſtruction to Jeruſalem for rejecting him their Meſſiah, then is the deſtroying of mens lives</hi> by the <hi>Civill Magiſtrate for contradicting the moſt funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall Doctrines of Chriſt, agreeable to the Spirit of Chriſt.</hi> Doth the Antecedent and conſequent in this hypotheticall propoſition agree any whit better then harp and harrow? Is <hi>the contradicting</hi> of what a man knowes no ſufficient ground or reaſon, why he ſhould judge, or thinke it to be a Truth, nor with his beſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours is able ſo to judge of it (which according to the common Tenet of theſe men themſelves, is the caſe of all unregenerate men, in reſpect of the fundamentall Doctrines of Chriſt) a ſinne of the like nature, or equally puniſhable, with the ſinne of <hi>Sacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſſimulation;</hi> which the ſinner cannot but know to be an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination?

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:159924:27"/>
together; which threatning notwithſtanding was not<note place="margin">Sect. 14.</note> put in execution till almoſt fourty yeares after it was denounced; is ſuch a threatning (I ſay) as this by <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe, of a like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration with the actuall and preſent inflicting of the puniſhment of death upon a man by a Civill Magiſtrate, onely for contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting in words ſuch or ſuch Tenets in Chriſtian Religion, ſuppoſe the <hi>moſt fundamentall,</hi> of the Truth, or likelihood whereof the miſerable wretch hath no aſſurance, nor (perhaps) knoweth how to come by any? Whatſoever an Apoſtle may doe by the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate and infallible direction of the Holy Ghoſt; nay, whatſoever Chriſt himſelfe may doe by vertue of his Authority and Intereſt, having all power of Judicature put into his hand by God, may a Magiſtrate doe by vertue of that limited Authority and Intereſt which he hath, and by the ſuggeſtion or direction of his owne ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit onely, or of thoſe that are ſubject unto errour and miſpriſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as well as his? Is it reaſonable to ſay that a child may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake as much as a man? or a Subject, as much as his Prince? Take a parallel of theſe mens reaſoning: if the Vine may bring forth grapes, why not the thorne? if the fig-tree figs, why not the thiſtle? Take another: If Presbytery be <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> why not Epiſcopacie? why not Independencie? If ſomething be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, why not nothing? The Faith of theſe men had need be ſtrong; for their reaſonings (I am certaine) are extremely weake. But their ſalve for this ſoare is; to injoyne their Proſelytes upon paine of death to caſt their Reaſon out of their Religion; and then <hi>quid libet</hi> will ſerve to prove <hi>quodlibet.</hi> But before I diſcharge them at this point, I muſt know of them, or at leaſt demand of them, by what light, new, or old, did they diſcerne this for a truth, that <hi>Peter by his word ſtruck Ananias and Sapphira dead for their Sacrilegious diſſimulation?</hi> Doe theſe men juſtifie the Argument of the Romiſh Diſputants, from <hi>Ecce duo gladii, Behold, here are two Swords,</hi> to prove that <hi>Peter</hi> was inveſted, as well with ſecular, as<note place="margin">a Luk. 22. 38.</note> Eccleſiaſtick power?

Or ſuppoſe it be, had <hi>Peter</hi> power to inflict it <hi>by his word?</hi> Did God impart his omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie unto him? Concerning <hi>Ananias</hi> it is indeed related how <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> according to the duty of his place, admoniſhed him of his ſin; and that <hi>Ananias</hi> upon hearing the Admonition or Reproofe, <hi>gave

Concerning the death of <hi>Sapphira,</hi> it is ſaid indeed that <hi>Peter</hi> foretold it, before it was inflicted; <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold</hi> (ſaith he, unto her) <hi>the feet of thoſe which have buried thy huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, are at the dore, and ſhall carrie thee out.</hi> But from theſe words, it cannot be concluded that <hi>Peter ſtruck Sapphira dead with his word,</hi> except onely in ſuch a ſenſe, as the faithfull Miniſters of this Land, may be ſaid to have <hi>ſtruck</hi> it with all thoſe heavy Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or plagues that have fallen upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it, in as much as they foretold and preadmoniſhed the Nation of them before they came. The greateſt difference is, that <hi>Peter</hi> had his prediction of <hi>Sapphira's</hi> death, by a more immediate revelation from God; the Miniſters have their predictions of the Judgements executed upon this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by the mediation of the Scriptures, which hold forth grounds for ſuch predictions. If Magiſtrates be able upon ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall grounds to foreſhew what Judgements will fall upon thoſe that ſhall <hi>oppoſe the Doctrines of Christ,</hi> in caſe theſe Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhall fall upon them accordingly without the Magiſtrates interpoſall for their procurement, I ſhall freely allow them this imitation of <hi>Peteter in ſtriking Ananias and Sapphira dead with his word.</hi> For I much doubt, whether it had been lawfull for <hi>Peter,</hi> having prophecied of <hi>Sapphira's</hi> death, to have ſlaine her with a Sword for the vindication of his Prophecie. But ſurely theſe men were not aware of their friends, (if of themſelves) when they pleaded the example of <hi>Peter ſmiting Ananias and Sapphira with death for diſſimulation, to</hi> ſtrengthen the hand of the Civill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to puniſh offenders accordingly. For I verily believe, were it his duty, and he conſcientious in the performance of it, to ſmite hypocriſie and <hi>diſſimulation</hi> with the Sword, that great and numerous party, which the Anti-Queriſts have for the preſent in the Land, would ſoone be reduced to the <hi>ſhaking of an olive tree,

            <p>For the firſt: this Anſwer (or rather, this part of their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer) ſtands upon two legs, (with much adoe) the firſt is this: That <hi>they who after admonition, maintaine damnable Hereſies, are no longer to be eſteemed Brethren, but enemies to Chriſt, &amp;c. and therefore are to be accordingly dealth with</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">page 4.</note>. This ground is true: but as true it is, that it is nothing to the purpoſe. For firſt, there is no menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any ſuch thing, as <hi>damnable hereſies,</hi> in the Argument which they propoſe to anſwer; but onely of <hi>ſuch opinions, which for ought the inflicters of death know, may be the ſacred Truths of Chriſt.</hi> If they will grant, that ſuch <hi>opinions,</hi> may be <hi>damnable Hereſies</hi> which <hi>for ought the men</hi> they ſpeak of <hi>know, may be ſacred Truths of Chriſt;</hi> I grant both the Truth and pertinencie of the ſuppoſition or ground: but if they grant it, it undoeth them in all they further have to ſay, either in way of Reaſon, or of paſſion, in this Anſwer (as will appeare preſently.) And</p>
            <p>Secondly, whereas they ſay, that <hi>ſuch who after admonition, ſhall maintaine damnable hereſies, &amp;c. are to be dealt with all accordingly, (i.</hi> either as God hath commanded, or as otherwiſe is reaſonable, in ſuch caſes) I know no man <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:159924:29"/>
theſe are the termes of the Syllogiſme, which they pretend to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.<note place="margin">Sect. 16.</note> Are theſe equipollent expreſſions in their Logick; <hi>to deale with an offender according to his offence;</hi> and, <hi>to inflict the heavie cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of death upon him?</hi> Surely theſe men are Stoicks, and hold the Paradox, <hi>Omnia peccata eſſe aequalia, i.</hi> that all ſins are equall. The queſtion between them and their Syllogiſme, is not, whether they <hi>who maintaine damnable hereſies after Admonition, be to be dealt with accordingly;</hi> no, nor yet, whether ſuch are to be puniſhed with <hi>death;</hi> but whether it <hi>be agreeable to the mind of Chriſt, for men to inflict the cenſure of death upon men, for holding forth ſuch opinions, which for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>quidem</hi> is to be found in all their Anſwer; neither in the more lightſome part of it, which ſhould have been reaſon (had it prov'd), nor yet in the darke of it, which is paſſion without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute.</p>
            <p>The ſecond leg made of reaſon (ſuch as it is) upon which this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer<note place="margin">Sect. 16.</note> ſtands, in the rationall part of it) is this: that <hi>the Opinions threatned with death in the Ordinance, the makers of the Ordinance doe CERTAIN<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>Y know to be damnable hereſies.</hi> This they prove by this Reaſon; <hi>becauſe they are contrary to the MANIFEST word of God, and overthrowing the very foundations of Chriſtian Religion.</hi> But</p>
            <p>(By the way) what if <hi>the makers of the Ordinance</hi> (which I and many more, ſuppoſe to be men of Clergie-orders, rather then perſons of any other Intereſt or capacity) <hi>have that certainty of knowledge</hi> which is here with ſo much confidence aſſerted to them, though this (I confeſſe) were it granted, would be ſomewhat to the Syllogiſme (though not much neither) yet is it nothing at all to the Querie, from whence the Syllogiſme pretends legitimacie of deſcent. For certaine I am that the Querie denies it not. If it be replyed; yea, but it intimates a deniall of i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. I demand, upon what ground is this ſuppoſition built? or what reaſon is there to charge the Querie, with ſuch an intimation? if it be anſwered; becauſe it was fram'd upon occaſion of the Ordinance, and ownes relation to it. And therefore, except ſome ſuch ſuppoſition as this be ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually contain'd in it, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>the makers of the Ordinance doe not certainly know the opinions threatned therein with death, to be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable hereſies,</hi> the Querie is altogether eccentricall, and irrelative to the point, to which it pretends. I anſwer, that this is a moſt

ſimple and unclerk-like allegation, and no wayes demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.<note place="margin">Sect. 17.</note> For</p>
            <p>Firſt, what though the Querie was fram'd upon occaſion of the<note place="margin">Sect. 17.</note> Ordinance, yet is it not neceſſary that it ſhould ſpeake to, or of, any of the particulars contained in the Ordinance. When a man being below, intends to goe up into a chamber, or upper roome, he doth not ſet his firſt, nor ſecond, nor third ſtep into the roome it ſelfe, whereinto his deſire is to enter, but ſteppeth at firſt upon lower ſtaires, which are at ſome diſtance from it. Nothing is more uſuall, then in examinations, and inquirings out of matters, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Juſtices of Peace, Judges, or others, at firſt to propoſe Queſtions or Queries to the perſons that are to be examined, that are preparatory onely, and introductive to ſuch further Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which ſtrike at the buſineſſe principally intended to be inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red after, and found out. I preſume the intent of the late Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſme of the preſent Church of <hi>England</hi> (ſo called) was, neither to teach the perſons that were to be cathechiſed, what <hi>their Names were,</hi> or <hi>who gave them their Names,</hi> nor yet to informe the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſt of either of theſe: but to inſtruct thoſe that were to be cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſed, in the fundamentall points of Chriſtian Religion. Yet we know that the framers of this Catechiſme, thought meet to begin with thoſe queſtions, <hi>VVhat is your Name:</hi> and, <hi>VVho gave you this Name;</hi> which doe not concerne immediately or directly any point of Religion, but to ſerve onely by way of introduction to thoſe queſtions which follow, and whoſe tendencie was, the inſtruction of the perſons catechiſed in things worthy to be knowne. So that to plead or to pretend, that, becauſe the body of my Queries was compiled upon occaſion of the Ordinance, therefore the firſt or ſecond Querie muſt directly and particularly ſtrike at the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, or any thing contained in it (much more at the makers of the Ordinance,) or elſe be altogether irrelative to it, is a kind of arguing, which cannot lightly proceed but from men of one of the worſt conſtitutions that are to be found amongſt Chriſtians, namely, ſuch, who are <hi>men</hi> onely <hi>in malice,</hi> and <hi>children in under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</hi> Therefore all that paſſionate and un-chriſtian bluſter, of <hi>wickedneſſe, blaſphemy, impudence, are you an Atheiſt, or a Devill,</hi> with all the reſt of the black Regiment of unhallowed expreſſions, which ſpread themſelves upon the fift and ſixt pages of the Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,

            <p>Reader, give me leave to trie to cut the combe of theſe mens<note place="margin">Sect. 21.</note> confidence, by propounding a Queſtion to them. I ſhall not aske them, what they are? whether they be Atheiſts, or Devills? they may poſſibly have learn'd by this how to anſwer theſe Queſtions. But the Querie I ſhall put to them is this; How, or by what means, or upon what grounds they themſelves <hi>CERTAINLY know,</hi> that this Opinion (which is one of thoſe, which as hath oft been ſaid, <hi>the Ordinance threatneth with death) viz.</hi> that <hi>God is not one in three Perſons,</hi> is either <hi>a damnable hereſie, or contrary to the manifeſt word of God, or overthrowing the foundations of Chriſtian Religion?</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine I am, that the Scriptures, which wee vulgar and unlearned
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:159924:32"/>
ones call the <hi>word of God</hi> (it may be the Seraphicall Doctors, to<note place="margin">Sect. 11.</note> whom wee now addreſſe, have ſome other <hi>word of God,</hi> which we know not of) no where affirmes, or holds forth this, that <hi>God is one in three Perſons;</hi> nor doth it any where uſe the terme, or word, perſon, in reference unto God. If it be replyed and ſaid; yea, but it plainely affirmeth, <hi>God to be One in Three:</hi> and it as plainely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth to every of theſe Three, ſuch things, which plainly evince them, to be ſo many Perſons. I anſwer,</p>
            <p>Firſt, that my memory ſerves me, as ill as the Conſciences and reaſons of theſe men ſerved their maſters in drawing up their <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication,</hi> that is, quite faileth me, if the Scripture any where plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirmeth, that <hi>God is One in Three.</hi> This certainly is a phraſe, or expreſſion, which the Scripture knoweth not. It is indeed ſaid, concerning <hi>the Father, the VVord, and the Holy Ghost,</hi> that <hi>theſe three are one</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">1 Joh. 5. 8.</note>. But to ſay, that <hi>God is one IN</hi> theſe, or any other, <hi>Three,</hi> is the voyce of men, not of God. Therefore theſe Gentlemen, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reaſonably or with Truth ſay, that they <hi>CERTAINLY know</hi> the deniall of this to be <hi>a damnable Hereſie, &amp;c.</hi> by the Scriptures, at leaſt not by the Scriptures alone, without the mediation and interveening of their owne reaſons and underſtandings, to draw it forth by way of inference or deduction. Now then, if the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which they have of any concluſion, ſuppoſe it be a Truth, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends, though but in part, upon the actings &amp; workings of their own reaſons and underſtandings, which are confeſſedly fallible, and very obnoxious to miſtakes, eſpecially in the things of God; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible it is that this <hi>knowledge</hi> ſhould be <hi>CERTAINE,</hi> yea though the grounds or principles, from whence they derive it, be never ſo <hi>CERTAINE</hi> or infallible. It is a knowne maxime in Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick; that <hi>Concluſio ſequitur deteriorem partem.</hi> If either of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes be but probable or contingent, the concluſion rais'd from them, will never be a neceſſary, or <hi>CERTAIN</hi> Truth. I confeſſe there is a great difference between deduction and deduction, inference and inference, in point of cleereneſſe and ſatisfactorineſſe to the Judgement and Conſcience of a man: one may have ſuch a kind of <hi>certainty</hi> or evidence in it in reſpect of him, that he is able to lay downe his life in atteſtation of the Truth of it, whereas (haply) he is not willing to ſacrifice the leaſt haire of his head upon the ſervice of another; yet the greateſt evidence or <hi>certainty</hi> to me in

            <p>Secondly, how much leſſe can theſe impatient and importune boaſters of their <hi>CERTAINE knowledge, know certainly that God is One in three Perſons</hi> (the denyall whereof <hi>the Ordinance threatneth with death</hi>) by the Scriptures alone, when as theſe no where aſſert it?

            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, (and laſtly, to this) confident I am, that if theſe great Confidentiaries of the <hi>certainty</hi> of <hi>their knowledge</hi> being three in number (if report miſ-counteth not) were but dealt with upon this occaſion, as thoſe baſe and bloody Elders are reported in the Apocryphall ſtory of <hi>Suſanna,</hi> to have been ſerv'd by <hi>Daniel</hi> upon another occaſion, I meane, were they preſently taken and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned apart each from other, what they meane by the word, <hi>PER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SON,</hi> when they ſay, <hi>God is one in three Perſons,</hi> they would agree no better in their Anſwers, then thoſe Elders did in theirs; but one would anſwer, that a <hi>Perſon,</hi> was a Myrtle tree; the ſecond, a lentiſh tree: the third, a tyle tree; my meaning is, that no one of them would agree with either of his fellowes, in his notion or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of a <hi>PERSON.</hi> And then with what face, can theſe ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies both of nature and Grace, require of poore, weake, ſimple and illiterate people, that they under paine of death, believe, <hi>that God is One in three Perſons,</hi> when as themſelves, who conceive they ride upon the wings of all knowledge, Learning, and underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, cannot agree among themſelves what <hi>a PERSON</hi> is; or if they doe agree, it is ten to one but it is an agreement in errour, and diſagreement with the Truth. Poore <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſoules! Were you ranſomed with the precious bloud of Jeſus Chriſt, to ſell your ſelves under the hand and power of ſuch hard and cruell Maſters as theſe? But</p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>For firſt, if this be a demonſtrative reaſon to <hi>the makers of the Ordinance,</hi> of the concluſion ſpecified, why is it not ſo to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? and particularly to thoſe, who are ſuppoſed either for the preſent to hold, or at leaſt to be in a poſſibility of holding, the <hi>Opinions threatned with death in the Ordinance?</hi> God forbid that I ſhould caſt the leaſt prejudice or aſperſion upon the makers of the Ordinance, whoſe Perſons are to me altogether unknowne: I am willing to hope the beſt, and to judge charitably of them, as <hi>viz.</hi> that they are men truly fearing God: But yet if the ſtrength or ſtreſſe of theſe mens Anſwer to their Syllogiſme, lieth in this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, I ſhall crave leave (I hope without offence) to require of them a probate of it. Nor for any doubt I have of the thing; but becauſe I doe not love to gratifie men in looſe diſputes. But this I confeſſe is no part of my charity towards them, to judge that to be demonſtrative unto them, which unto others of equall capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and underſtanding, if not ſuperior, is not ſo much as Topi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, or probably concluding. <hi>Porphyrie, Julian</hi> the Apoſtate, with many other adverſaries of Chriſtian Religion, of great abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and Learning, knew that all, or moſt of the <hi>Opinions threatned with death in the Ordinance, were contrary to the manifeſt word of God,</hi> I meane the Scriptures, and likewiſe <hi>overthrowing the very founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Chriſtian Religion;</hi> and yet they were ſo farre from <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing CERTAINLY</hi> hereby, that they were <hi>damnable hereſies,</hi> that they apprehended them not in the leaſt, to be ſo much as errours.

If I ſuppoſe (for example) that <hi>Peter</hi> may be ignorant whether <hi>James</hi> be in <hi>London</hi> or no; I cannot conclude that <hi>Peter</hi> knowes any thing, much leſſe <hi>knowes</hi> any thing <hi>CERTAINLY,</hi> by meanes of <hi>James</hi> his being in <hi>London,</hi> though it be never ſo true that there he is: yea, and that he hath inform'd <hi>Peter</hi> of never ſo many things. It is not the ground, cauſe, or reaſon of any thing which neceſſarily furniſheth a man with the knowledge of the thing; but the apprehenſion and knowledge of them, and that in their rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of cauſality unto the thing.

Is it then ſuch an hideous or enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous ſuppoſition, as theſe men deſire to informe the world in thunder and lightning; or is it at any ſuch diſtance from their owne Principles, to ſuppoſe, that men may poſſibly not <hi>know CERTAINLY</hi> the great Truths of the Goſpel, to be Truths? and conſequently, not <hi>know CERTAINLY,</hi> that <hi>the opinions threatned with death in the Ordinance, are damnable hereſies?</hi> Is there any thing more horrid or ſtrange in ſuch a ſuppoſition,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:159924:35"/>
then there is in this; that God hath not by the ſupernaturall, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible,<note place="margin">Sect. 26.</note> immedate worke of his Spirit, revealed and ſealed up to the Conſciences of many men, the unqueſtionable Truth of the Goſpel? And is it any thing more ſtrange to ſuppoſe this, then it is to ſuppoſe, that all men are not Kings, nor all Princes, nor all Nobles, nor all wiſe, nor all rich, with the like? Surely theſe men through the abundance of their zeale, will ſhortly vote it, <hi>wickedneſſe, blaſphemie, impudence, Atheiſme, Devilliſme,</hi> an impiety calling for <hi>an Anathema, a delivering up unto Satan, &amp;c.</hi> for a man to ſuppoſe or intimate, that light is not darkneſſe; or that darkneſſe is not light; that ſweet is not bitter, or, that bitter is not ſweet; that a mans feet are not his hands, or that his head is not his feet. The moſt cleere and pregnant truth is, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation, wherewith they charge the Querie now in Sanctuarie, (and this undeſervedly too) and againſt which they riſe up in the might of their indignation, is of no more demerit, no more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy cenſure, then one of theſe; yea and that the moſt innocent of them, if any be ſuſpected. Deare Engliſh ſoules, take heed of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Scepter into the hands of theſe men. For they can be angry and become Lyons, and call eares, hornes, when they pleaſe.</p>
            <p>By the way, before wee leave this point, I deſire, by occaſion of the ground lately mentioned, as the common, if not the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, Tenet of our beſt and moſt Orthodoxe Writers, that it be taken into ſerious conſideration; whether, or how farre it is meet to puniſh or cenſute poore miſerable men, for not holding, or not aſſerting the Truth of thoſe things; which they cannot come, without much labour and contention of mind, yea not without ſome good degree of reaſon and underſtanding too, to judge ſo much as probable; nor at al to come to believe or know them <hi>CER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAINLY,</hi> but onely by an immediate and ſupernaturall work of the Spirit of God? Are men to be puniſhed, becauſe God hath not imparted unto them his Spirit of Grace, and ſupernaturall il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination?</p>
            <p>Seventhly, and laſtly; Neither is it true (as hath been prov'd at<note place="margin">Sect. 26.</note> large) that <hi>all the opinions threatned with death in the Ordinance,</hi> are <hi>either contrary to the manifeſt word of God, or overthrowing the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of Chriſtian Religion.</hi> Therefore no ſuch <gap reason="foreign">

Firſt, that all the <hi>Opinions ſentenced with death in the Ordinance,</hi> are <hi>not contrary to the manifeſt word of God,</hi> is evident by what hath been already argued, concerning this (which is one of them) <hi>viz. that God is not one in three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi>

So againe, <hi>That Chriſt is not God coequall with the Father</hi> (which is another of theſe Opinions;) neither is this <hi>contrary</hi> to any <hi>mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt word of God</hi> in the ſenſe declared: though I judge it contrary to the Truth. <hi>Probatio incumbit affirmanti:</hi> Let the aſſertors of it to be ſo, prove their aſſertion; but to ſay much, and prove little, is one of the principall pillars in their Schoole. So againe, <hi>that Chriſts death is not meritorious in the behalfe of believers,</hi> is another of theſe <hi>Opinions:</hi> I marvell what <hi>manifeſt word of God</hi> they will finde, unto which this is <hi>contrary. That the Scriptures are not the word of God,</hi> is another: taking the word, <hi>Scriptures,</hi> for all the bookes of the Old and New Teſtament, <hi>divifim</hi> and <hi>conjunctim</hi> as they are now received and acknowledged amongſt us (which is the onely ſenſe the Ordinance can reaſonably meane) if they can find me any <hi>manifeſt word of God,</hi> whereunto this is <hi>contrary,</hi> I will in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of ſuch a favour, abate them three abſurdities and foure, in the ſequell of my examination of their Vindication.

            </p>
            <p>Their third Argument rejoyceth againſt their Anſwer given to it, becauſe this alſo is built upon ſandy foundations. As 1. that <hi>to be called Rabbi, is to require men to beleeve that which they teach them, meerly becauſe they teach it without any Authoritie</hi> from God in his Word. This is a moſt ſtrange, and truthleſſe ſaying; and excuſeth Scribes and Phariſees, (and who not?) from ever deſiring to be called <hi>Rabbi.</hi> For certainly none of theſe were ever ſo ſimple, as <hi>to require men to beleeve that which they taught them, MEERLY becauſe they taught it without any Authoritie from God in his word.</hi> There was none of them all, but pretended <hi>Authoritie from God in his word, for what they taught;</hi> but eſpecially, it is the firſt-borne of incredibilities, that they ſhould <hi>require men to beleeve what they taught them,</hi> upon this ground, <hi>MEERLY becauſe they taught it without any Authoritie from God in his word.</hi> Can it enter into the heart of a man, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of any man that profeſſeth the ſervice of the true God, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe of the Scriptures, to thinke honorably of his Teacher, <hi>MEER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LY</hi> and ſimply <hi>becauſe he teacheth without any Authoritie from God in his word?</hi> Certainly if the Scribes and Phariſees had fiſh'd with this baite, eſpecially amongſt the <hi>Jewes,</hi> for the acclamations of <hi>Rabbi,</hi> they had caught nothing but contempt and ſhame in ſtead thereof. Therefore for men to <hi>enjoyne or compell men</hi> to call them <hi>Rabbi,</hi> is (in the ſence of the Querie, &amp; in the Scripture import of the phraſe) either to enjoyne them (eſpecially under any penaltie, as of their diſ-favour, or the diſ-favour of God, or otherwiſe) to receive or beleeve any Doctrine, as the Truth of God, becauſe they teach it for ſuch, <hi>viz.</hi> either as a true Interpretation of, or deduction from the word of God, whether they give any ſufficient account that it is either the one, or the other, unto thoſe, on whom they impoſe upon ſuch terms, this tribute of beliefe; or elſe to prohibit them, on the like terms, the holding and maintaining of ſuch or ſuch Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, becauſe they judge them to be contrary to the word of God,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:159924:39"/>
without giving any ſufficient account or reaſon unto the prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,<note place="margin">Sect. 32.</note> to prove them ſo. Now I querie the Anti-Queriſts, whether the makers of the Ordinance doe not in this ſence, <hi>compell men to call them Rabbi; i.</hi> Whether they doe not prohibit men under pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties, and thoſe moſt grievous, from holding forth ſuch and ſuch Doctrines, as being contrary to the word of God, without giving any ſufficient account (or indeed any at all; that I ſay not, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being able to give any that is ſufficient) unto the perſons thus prohibited, that they are indeed contrary to this word.</p>
            <p>2. The Anſwer now under correction, is polluted with this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane<note place="margin">Sect. 32.</note> ſuppoſition; <hi>viz.</hi> that the makers of the Ordinance doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe therein, that can be interpreted a deſire <hi>to be called Rabbi, then to charge men that they teach no other Doctrine, then what the word of God holds forth, and the Prophets and Apoſtles have taught</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Pag. 7.</note>. Moſt unworthy men! Firſt, there is not one jot or tittle of any ſuch <hi>charge</hi> as this in the Ordinance. 2. There is that in the Ordinance (which was even now mentioned) which in the ſtricteſt and moſt proper ſence of the phraſe, is to <hi>compell men to call them Rabbi;</hi> and this of no affinitie at all with the tenour or ſubſtance of ſuch a charge. And whereas it further addeth; that <hi>if any Church-Cenſures be to be uſed for any matter of Doctrine, this will be as much to force men to call them Rabbi, as the Civill Magiſtrates making this Ordinance, forces any to call them Rabbi:</hi> I anſwer, this aſſertion or compariſon is true, onely with this explication, <hi>viz.</hi> when <hi>any Church-Cenſure ſhall be uſed for any matter of Doctrine,</hi> without any ſufficient account given by this Church of the erroneouſneſſe of this Doctrine, unto the perſon, or perſons, againſt whom the cenſure ſhall paſſe. In this caſe, <hi>Church-Cenſures</hi> for <hi>matters of Doctrine,</hi> and the Ordinance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſures, are much of one and the ſame conſideration<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>3. As this Anſwer ſaith, that <hi>for the proofe of the minor, it is nothing elſe, but a reiteration in other language of the former blaſphemies againſt the Doctrine of God and Chriſt, belched out in the former Querie, and needs no other anſwer then that;</hi> ſo ſay I of this aſſertion; <hi>it is nothing elſe but a reiteration</hi> in fewer words, of thoſe truth-leſſe, reaſon-leſſe, ſap-leſſe, ſence-leſſe imputations, <hi>belched out</hi> againſt that Querie, <hi>and needs no other Anſwer,</hi> then what hath been already at large gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to it. But</p>
            <p>4. (And laſtly) This Anſwer is a moſt notorious Delinquent<note place="margin">Sect. 33.</note>

            </p>
            <p>In their fourth Argument, as likewiſe in their Anſwer to it, they<note place="margin">Sect. 34.</note> take no notice at all, of what the Querie honeſtly deſired to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind them, <hi>viz.</hi> of any <hi>dying themſelves for the maintenance and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of</hi> their <hi>Religion;</hi> but onely of <hi>putting others to death</hi> for th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Or if I ſhould goe about to prove,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:159924:40"/>
that ſuch or ſuch an habit, is of the <hi>French</hi> faſhion, becauſe it is of<note place="margin">Sect. 34.</note> the <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> would they approve my Logique? If they did, I ſhould ſcarce approve of their approbation. And is there any better ſinew in their reaſoning, wherein they prove a thing to be Chriſtian, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is Jewiſh? Yea, but they were aware of this exception, and way-layed it thus. This <hi>Law of God</hi> given under the old Teſtament, for <hi>putting falſe Prophets, Blaſphemers, and ſeducers to Idolatrie, to death, is ſtill in force, even for the maintenance of Religion.</hi> But how doe they prove this? thus: becauſe <hi>the reaſon which God gives of ſuch a Law, is this; that all the people may heare and feare, and doe no more ſo wickedly. Deut.</hi> 13. 11. The ground upon which this reaſon ſtands, and muſt be made Orthodox, (if there be any ſuch thing in it) is this; that whilſt the reaſon of any Commandement or Law takes place, or is in force, the Law or Commandement it ſelfe, grounded upon that reaſon, muſt take place, and be in force alſo. But of how ill a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance ſuch a reaſon or aſſertion as this, is with the Truth, will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently appeare by theſe parallels; <hi>Abraham received the ſigne of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, a ſeale of the righteouſneſſe of Faith</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 4. 11.</note>; <hi>i.</hi> in the nature of a ſeale, or, that it might be a ſeale, unto him, and his poſteritie, <hi>of the righteouſneſſe of Faith.</hi> But this end of Circumciſion, the <hi>ſealing of the righteouſneſſe of Faith,</hi> ſtill takes place; <hi>i.</hi> it is ſtill neceſſary, that <hi>the righteouſneſſe of Faith</hi> be ſealed unto men. Therefore <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> or the Law commanding Circumciſion, is <hi>ſtill in force.</hi> Take another; God commanded the <hi>children of Iſrael under the old Teſtament, to make them fringes in the border of their garments, thoroughout their generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> (there is no ſuch clauſe as this in the Law for putting blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers or Idolaters to death, for the perpetuation of it,) <hi>and that they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blue; And that it ſhould be unto them for a fringe, that they might look upon it, and remember all the Commandements of the Lord, and doe them, and that they ſeek not after their own heart, and their own eyes</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Num. 15. 38, 39.</note>. But the end of theſe <hi>fringes,</hi> and of the looking of them, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>remembring of all the Commandements of the Lord, and the doing of them,</hi> and <hi>the not ſeeking after our own heart, or eyes,</hi> takes place, and is ſtill in force under the New Teſtament. Therfore the commandement which enjoyns them for ſuch an end, is ſtill in force: and conſequently the Anti-Queriſts ought to weare <hi>fringes with a ribband of blue upon their garments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it be here anſwered and ſaid; it's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <note place="margin">Sect. 35.</note> though the end of them ſtill takes place, and remaines under the New Teſtament, yet the Commandements themſelves, and the Ceremonies or typicall things commanded, are aboliſhed by Chriſt; but the putting of Idolaters, blaſphemers, falſe Prophets to death, are not Ceremonies, or things typicall; Therefore the Lawes injoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe may remaine in force, though the other be aboliſhed; and the rather, becauſe their end (as hath been ſaid) remaineth. But for Anſwer,</p>
            <p>1. Be it ſo; that theſe latter commands were not abrogated by Chriſt, (though the Truth will appeare on the other ſide) yet the Gentlemens reaſon urged for their non-abrogation, is lame; <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>their end is ſtill in force.</hi> If this were a ſufficient reaſon for the non-abrogation of a Law, thoſe other Lawes enjoyning Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, would be ſtill in force, and as much un-abrogated, as theſe; their ends (as hath been proved) remaining in force, as well as the end of theſe. And theſe Gentlemen (I make no queſtion) know by this time, that they are in a Logique <hi>premunire</hi> in this argument, as being guilty of treaſon againſt that ſoveraigne Maxime; <hi>A quatenus, ad de omni, efficax eſt illatio.</hi> And yet the truth is, that if the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the ends in force, of thoſe Lawes they ſpeake of under the old Teſtament, be altogether impertinent and inſufficient (as wee have ſhewed it is) to evince a ſtill-ſtanding, or a non-abrogation of the Lawes themſelves; I know not how to relieve them in this caſe, nor where to finde a reaſon better colouring with ſuch a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. But</p>
            <p>2. Neither is it ſuch a Sun-ſhine Truth, to ſay that the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments enjoyned by God under the Old Teſtament, were not typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call. Certaine I am, that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> having ſpoken particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly of ſeverall puniſhments executed by God upon his people un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Old Teſtament, upon the occaſion concludes thus: <gap reason="foreign">

Earth, and more of Heaven in them; So if I ſhall ſay, that the<note place="margin">Sect. 36.</note> threatenings, or puniſhments alſo enjoyned by God then, (I meane under the Leviticall Law) to be inflicted in his Church upon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents, were more bodily, and afflictive to the outer man, then the puniſhments enjoyned under the Goſpel, and conſequently, were not onely carnall or bodily, but typicall alſo, and preſignificative of thoſe greater and more ſpirituall in the Goſpel; I ſay, if I ſhould reaſon thus <hi>à comparatis,</hi> I beleeve I ſhould receive no better anſwer to my Argument from my Claſſique Antagoniſts, then I have done to my <hi>Queries</hi> in their <hi>Vindication.</hi> For certainly, the Analogie is ſavourie and Scripture-like: that as God, when he diſcovered and opened Heaven more then he had done formerly, thought good to put more of it, and of things relating to it, and leſſe of the Earth, and of the things thereof, into thoſe promiſes of his, by which he now intended to gather in the world unto him; in like manner, when he had diſcovered Hell alſo, and the dreadfull terror thereof, farre beyond all former diſcoveries, that he ſhould put more of it, and of things relating to it, and leſſe of outward or bodily ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, into thoſe threatenings or puniſhments, by which his purpoſe was to vindicate the Goſpel, with the Grace thereof from diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and contempt in his Churches. <hi>Cutting off from his people,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, is exchanged, for <hi>caſting out from his people,</hi> under the Goſpel. And if the expreſſion <hi>of cutting off,</hi> be any where found in the Goſpel, it is metaphoricall, and alluſive onely to the uſuall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of dealing with, or at leaſt of threatening offenders under the Law; being ſuch a figurative expreſſion, as that wherein <hi>Beleevers,</hi> are called <hi>Prieſts</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Revel. 1. 6.</note>; and their diſtributions, or almes-deeds, <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Heb. 13.</note>.</p>
            <p>3. There is this cleere reaſon, why that Old Teſtament Law, for<note place="margin">Sect. 36.</note> the putting of <hi>falſe Prophets, Blaſphemers, and ſeducers to Idolatrie, to death,</hi> ſhould not now be in force upon any ſuch terms as it was, when, and where it was given; becauſe in all difficult caſes that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened about matters of Religion, the <hi>Jewes</hi> to whom this Law was given, had the opportunitie of immediate conſultation with the mouth of God himſelfe; who could, and did from time to time, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly declare what his own mind and pleaſure was in them. So that except thoſe that were to give ſentence in caſes of Religion, had been deſperately wicked, and ſet upon bloud, and had deſpiſed that
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:159924:41"/>
glorious Ordinance of the Oracle of God amongſt them, they could<note place="margin">Sect. 36.</note> not doe injuſtice; becauſe God himſelfe was alwayes at hand, to declare unto them what was meet to be done; and what kinde of Blaſphemer, and ſo what kinde of Idolater particularly it was, that he by his Law intended ſhould be put to death. Whereas now, the beſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>acles that Magiſtrates and Judges have to direct them in doubtfull caſes abou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> matters of Religion, are men of very fallible judgements, and every wayes obnoxious unto error and miſtake. Yea confident I am, that the wiſeſt and moſt learned of them, are not able cleerly or demonſtratively to informe the Magiſtrate or Judge, what <hi>Blaſphemy,</hi> or <hi>what Idolatrie</hi> it was, which was by God ſentenced to death under the Law. I cannot but think that they will (for acquaintance ſake) be mercifull unto that <hi>Idolatrie,</hi> (and not vote with the old Law againſt it) which yet the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> condemnes, and commands to be <hi>mortified, (Col.</hi> 3. 5.) And for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other things or practiſes, which are commonly called <hi>Idolatrie,</hi> and ſo (I queſtion not) voted by theſe men; I muſt (for conſcience ſake) ſo farre be mercifull unto them, as not to judge them neither ſentenced by God to death in that Law. And for that <hi>Blaſphemie,</hi> which was made puniſhable with death by this Law; ſome of the <hi>Jewes</hi> reſtraine it onely to the naming or expreſſing of the Name <hi>Jehovah;</hi> others of them, extend it no further then to the naming of this, and that other Name of God, <hi>Adonaic</hi>. I preſume that our Anti-Querie-maſters themſelves doe not judge the naming of either the one, or the other, or both of theſe Names, to be a Blaſphemie worthy death: no nor yet to be the Blaſphemie ſentenced by God to death under the Law. Where our Engliſh Tranſlation readeth, <hi>Blaſphemeth, And whoſoever ſhall blaſpheme the Name of the Lord, (Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit.</hi> 24. 16.) The Chaldee tranſlateth, <hi>expreſſeth:</hi> the Septuagint, <hi>nameth;</hi> (which they doe alſo, verſ. 11. <note n="a" place="margin">See M. <hi>Ainſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi> upon the places.</note>) <hi>Junius</hi> and <hi>Tremellius</hi> reade the clauſe thus: <hi>Qui verò execratur nomen Jehovae,</hi> i. <hi>But who ſo curſeth the Name of Jehovah.</hi> So that it ſeemes the greateſt Doctors, both of Jewes and Gentiles, differ, and are at a loſſe, the light of their great learning notwithſtanding, about the nature, qualitie, or kinde of that Blaſphemie, which was by God made puniſhable with death in his Law. But our Anti-Queriſts (it ſeemes) are wiſer then either Jewes or Gentiles. Therefore to goe about to prove, that the Law for putting <hi>Blaſphemers, and ſeducers to Idolatrie to death,</hi> is now,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:159924:42"/>

               <note n="g" place="margin">Verſ. 16.</note>. Theſe are the plaine words of the Law. 8. (And laſtly) it was not lawfull to preſerve any thing, though never ſo little, of the ſtuffe or goods belonging to this Citie; but it was, even every whit of it to be burnt with fire. <hi>And thou ſhalt gather</hi> (ſaith <hi>Moſes) all the ſpoyle of it into the midſt of the ſtreet thereof, and ſhalt burne with fire the Citie, and all the ſpoyle thereof, every whit</hi> 
               <note n="h" place="margin">Ibid.</note>. So then, if the men with whom we have to doe, will needs raiſe the dead unto life, and give preſent vigor and force to the Commandement of God under the Old Law for putting <hi>Blaſphemers</hi> and <hi>Idolaters</hi> to death; I muſt ſay

unto them, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to the <hi>Galatians</hi> in the caſe of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion;<note place="margin">Sect. 37.</note>

               <note n="a" place="margin">Gal. 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3.</note>. In like manner if men will urge the Law for putting thoſe oft-named Offenders unto death, as being ſtill in force, they make themſelves <hi>debtors,</hi> to require and urge the execution of this <hi>whole Law,</hi> in all the particularities and circumſtances thereunto belonging, as they have been mentioned. For who hath any power to make an Election and Reprobation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Commandements of God, where God himſelfe hath made none? Or to ſay unto him, in this, or in that wee will obey thee, but in a third, and a fourth, we muſt be excuſed? Is this the Divinitie, and conſcience of theſe men? If therefore there be no perſwading of them, but that the ſaid Offenders muſt needs die by vertue of that Law ſo oft ſpecified, let them firſt provide and preſſe it as matter of dutie and conſcience upon the Magiſtrate or Judge, that they die no other death, then by ſtones: 2.

            <p>6. If the obligation of the Moſaicall Law for putting Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, Idolaters, &amp;c. to death, was intended by God to continue un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the New Teſtament, why was the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> ſo farre from enjoyning a <hi>beleeving Brother,</hi> to detect, or to put to death, his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell, or Idolatrous wife, that he doth not permit him ſo much as <hi>to put her away</hi> from him, in caſe <hi>ſhee pleaſe to dwell with him</hi>

then was every perſon in an Idolatrous State or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,<note place="margin">Sect. 40.</note> whilſt it remained wholly Idolatrous, bound thereby, to ſeek the death one of another, yea and to deſtroy one another with their own hande. Yea the civill Magiſtrate was bound to ſentence all his Subjects that practiſed Idolatry, to death, without exception; and conſequently to make a bloudy deſolation thoroughout all his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions. To pretend, that the ſaid Law takes hold onely of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Magiſtrates, and binds them to the execution mentioned, not on Magiſtrates whilſt they are yet Heathen; is a ridiculous pretence. For what dutie ſoever belongs unto a Magiſtrate, as ſuch, belongs to every Magiſtrate, of what capacitie or condition ſoever he be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe. Or if the pretence were admitted as legitimate, yet would not the abſurditie be at all healed by it, but rather heightened. Becauſe even then it would follow, that in caſe the Supreme Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate in an Idolatrous State or Kingdome, were firſt converted to the Chriſtian ſaith, he were bound by vertue of this his converſion, to deſtroy the lives of all his ſubjects without exception, whom the preſent caſe are ſuppoſed to be all Idolaters.

I anſwer; there is no ſuch clauſe of mitigation or reſpit, as this, in the ſaid Law; but the Idolater, and the Blaſphemer, were forthwith, upon the truth of the fact evidenced by witneſſes, to be put to death <note n="a" place="margin">Levit. 24. 14. 16.</note>. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if this Law be ſtill in force, it muſt be put in execution with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſuch explication, or reſerve: the addition of ſuch an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation makes a new Law, and doth not eſtabliſh, but rather diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anulleth the old, as if it were <hi>weake and unprofitable.</hi>

            <p>8.

Whereas the Goſpel requires a quite contrary deportment in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians towards ſuch, <hi>viz.</hi> that which was loving and harmleſſe, and apt to gaine upon them, and to perſwade them into the Chriſtian

The <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> alſo both held and taught many moſt dangerous and erroneous Doctrines, yea ſuch by which (as our Saviour himſelfe chargeth them) <hi>they made the Commandements of God of none eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 15. 3, 4. 6.</note>. Yet were theſe alſo in great honour and eſteeme in this Church and State. And though our Saviour upon occaſion reaſoned againſt, yea and reprov'd them all, for holding and teaching theſe errors, and gave warning unto the people to take heed of them; yet did he never charge this Church or State, or thoſe that bare office in either, with ſin, or unfaithfulneſſe in their places, for not proceeding againſt them, in regard of their errors, either by impriſonment, or death. And yet we know, that <hi>the zeale of his Fathers houſe did eate him up;</hi> and that he attempted a Reformation amongſt them, eſpecially in matters of Religion, and the worſhip of God, with an high hand of zeale, wiſdome, and Authoritie <note n="c" place="margin">Joh. 2. 14, 15, &amp;c.</note>; Yea, as <hi>Solomon ſpake of trees, from the Cedar that is in Lebanon, even unto the hyſſope that ſpringeth out of the wall</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">1 King. 4. 33.</note>; ſo did Chriſt teach and preſſe upon men, all, and all manner of duties, from <hi>judgement, mercy, and faith, (the mightie things of the Law)</hi> even unto <hi>the paying tithe of mint, aniſe, and cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi> 
               <note n="e" place="margin">Mat. 23. 23.</note>. Therefore by the <hi>falſe Prophet,</hi> who was commanded to <hi>be put to death,</hi> Deut. 13. 5. was not meant every <hi>Heretique,</hi> or erroneous perſon, (as men in theſe dayes count hereſie and error; who ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence every opinion, which oppoſeth, either their eaſe, or their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, or their profit, either as the one, or the other) nor yet thoſe who taught or publiſhed any falſe doctrine, though of dangerous conſequence; but onely thoſe, who endeavoured to perſwade men to the worſhip of a falſe God; and that by affirming, that they ſpake by the inſpiration of ſome deitie, and that their ſayings were to be eſteemed Oracles. What doctrine it was, which made the Prophet or Teacher of it guiltie of death, is expreſly determined in the Law it ſelf, and aſſerted to be this; <hi>Let us goe after other Gods, which thou haſt not knowne, and let us ſerve them</hi> 
               <note n="f" place="margin">Deut. 13. 2.</note>. And that the Law of God made againſt <hi>falſe Prophets,</hi> and worſhippers of falſe Gods, was not intended againſt thoſe, who otherwiſe held that the Law of God was to be kept, but were infected with ſome other error, is ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evident from hence; becauſe in former times among the Jews, who
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:159924:45"/>
were affected with a vehement love and zeale towards their Law,<note place="margin">Sect. 42.</note> Heretiques notwithſtanding (as hath been already obſerved) were tolerated; and particularly the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> (of whoſe errors and hereſies we ſpake before.) Theſe, although the greateſt part both of the People and the Rulers beleeved them to erre exceedingly, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe they were not expelled the Citie, neither exempted from being Magiſtrates, or bearing any other civill office: yea they were not hindered from coming to the Temple or the Synagogues.</p>
            <p>All theſe things conſidered, I referre it to the arbitrement of all men of underſtanding, whether of the firſt, ſecond, or third degree, whether our Anti-Querie-men, or their complices, who ſo paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately rejoyce over the old Law for putting <hi>falſe Prophets, Idolaters, and Blaſphemers to death,</hi> as if it countenanced their occupation, of traducing, troubling, moleſting, perſecuting, even the Saints of God themſelves, for holding and profeſſing ſuch opinions, which they are pleas'd to call errors or hereſies; whether (I ſay) the ſaid Law hath any more communion with ſuch practiſes or proceedings, then <hi>light</hi> hath <hi>with darkneſſe,</hi> or <hi>Chriſt</hi> with <hi>Belial.</hi> And yet this Law is the firſt-borne of their ſtrength, whereby they edifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in this Doctrine of violence and bloud. O Church of <hi>England,</hi> and you that number your ſelves amongſt the members thereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of men, I meane your Teachers, leſt they become <hi>Jewes</hi> unto you, and goe about to perſwade you, <hi>that they have a Law;</hi> and <hi>that by their Law</hi> Chriſt himſelfe <hi>ought to die</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Joh. 19. 7.</note>.</p>
            <p>They faulter in their Anſwer to their fift and ſixt argument, (as<note place="margin">Sect. 42.</note> they call it) firſt, by affirming, or, which is equivalent to it, cleerly ſuppoſing, that <hi>ſtratagems, methods, and waies of violence and bloud, (viz.</hi> ſo ordered, and put in execution upon ſuch occaſions, as the Ordinance directeth; for except this be their meaning, they anſwer nothing to the purpoſe, nor at all to the Querie) are <hi>thoſe wayes which God himſelfe commanded to be uſed for the ſupport of the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi> This we have lately proved to be notoriouſly falſe. God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver commanded any violence to be uſed, nor any bloud to be ſhed, nor any civill penalty to be inflicted, for any error, or miſpriſion in judgement about matters of Religion; but onely in caſe of ſeducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the worſhip of falſe Gods; which notwithſtanding the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance doth not at all touch or mention.

unlike men of much underſtanding. For 1. who doe they meane by<note place="margin">Sect. 43.</note> this Pronoune, <hi>THEY?</hi> wee have no ſubſtantive, one or more anteceding, unto which it can relate, but onely <hi>Papiſts,</hi> or wicked men. And did <hi>God himſelf command thoſe wayes</hi> of violence and bloud, which the Ordinance inſiſteth upon, <hi>to be uſed</hi> by either of theſe <hi>for the ſupport of true Religion, as ſoone as they had any civill Magiſtrates?</hi> Tight Divinitie! Secondly, if by the pronoune, <hi>THEY,</hi> they meane the Jewes (which ſeems to be their meaning) I wonder, and would willingly learne, how long it was, after the pretended Command given unto them <hi>for the ſupport of true Religion,</hi> before they <hi>had Civill Magiſtrates?</hi> becauſe theſe learned Clerks ſuppoſe ſome Interim. Doubtleſſe they had <hi>Moſes,</hi> both before, and when, and ſome while after, the ſaid Command was given unto them by God: and I have not heard that ever <hi>Moſes</hi> was voted out of his civill Magiſtracy by any Synod or Aſſembly.

               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:159924:46"/>
Did it ever enter in the heart of an underſtanding or conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring<note place="margin">Sect. 44.</note> man, to imagine, that thoſe <hi>waies,</hi> or morall practices, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in even the worſt or vileſt of men (as Heatheniſh and Antichriſtian Idolaters are) generally walke, are <hi>according to the light and Law of nature?</hi> Certainly this ſaying, was rather ſpoken <hi>according to the light and Law of nature; Recti argumentum eſt, peſſimis diſplicere.</hi> i.

And if it be <hi>accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the light and Law of nature,</hi> to <hi>ſupport Religion</hi> by <hi>methods and waies</hi> of outward violence and bloud, I deſire to know, of what Religion this is aſſerted, whether of that which is true, or that which is Idolatrous and falſe. If of the former, then is it notoriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrary <hi>to the light and Law of nature,</hi> to ſeek to deſtroy <hi>the true Religion</hi> by methods and waies of violence and bloud; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, the heatheniſh and Antichriſtian Idolaters, who attempted the deſtruction of <hi>the true Religion</hi> for <hi>the ſupport</hi> of their own by ſuch meanes, walked not according to, but directly againſt <hi>the light and Law of nature</hi> in ſo doing. And then this practiſe of theirs, is ſo farre from being any argument, that waies of violence and bloud <hi>for ſupporting Religion,</hi> are <hi>according to the Law and light of nature,</hi> that it argueth the contrary. If it be underſtood of the latter, <hi>viz.</hi> of an Idolatrous or falſe <hi>Religion,</hi> certainly no <hi>ſupport</hi> of this by any means whatſoever, is <hi>according to the light or Law of nature;</hi> in as much as theſe directly lead to the abhorring and deteſting of all ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions, not to the ſupporting of them in any kinde.

            <p>Firſt, evident it is, that the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. ſets forth the duty, intereſt, and power of a Magiſtrate, ſimply, as a Magiſtrate, not as a Magiſtrate qualified in one kinde or other, leaſt of all as

            <p>Secondly, it is altogether inconſiſtent with the wiſedome and goodneſſe of God in the Government of the world, ſo much as to intereſſe, much more to lay a neceſſity upon, his Deputies, the civill Magiſtrates or Rulers hereof, to interpoſe with their power in ſuch things, whereof, for the generality and farre the greateſt part of them, he knew they would be not onely ignorant, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable; yea, and not onely they (I mean the Magiſtrates them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) but even farre the greateſt part of men alſo; yea, even thoſe men themſelves, who he knew would pretend with as much height and confidence to a knowledge of them, as any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. And certaine it is, that matters of <hi>Errour</hi> and <hi>Hereſie</hi> in Chriſtian Religion, are of this nature; at leaſt a very great part of them. For who did ever pretend, challenge, or claime, a deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er inſight into matters of <hi>Errour</hi> and <hi>Hereſie</hi> in Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, a greater ſufficiency or dexterity to judge and determine, what was <hi>Errour,</hi> what not, what was <hi>Hereſie,</hi> what not, then the Papal Biſhops and Clergy, in the day of their power, and eſpecially the Pope himſelf? And yet we know, and generally confeſſe, that al theſe were incompetent and inſufficient judges in ſuch matters as theſe, &amp; that they did from time to time <hi>put darkeneſſe for light, and light for darkneſſe; bitter for ſweet, and ſweet for bitter;</hi> condemned Truth to death, inſtead of Error; advancing Error inſtead of Truth.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If Magiſtrates, as ſuch, be uncapable themſelves of<note place="margin">Sect. 46.</note> diſcerning between Errour and Truth in Chriſtian Religion, as put the caſe, between the Congregationall Government, and that of Presbytery, which is agreeable to the word of God, and which not, or whether both, or whether neither: to whom, or to what generation of men can they ſafely entruſt their judgements and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:159924:48"/>
conſciences in this caſe for regulation and direction, ſo as to run<note place="margin">Sect. 46</note> no hazard of incurring the wrath of God, for ſmiting with the ſword without cauſe? If it be ſaid, they muſt and may ſafely truſt the godly, orthodox, and faithfull Miniſters, amongſt whom they live;</p>
            <p>I anſwer firſt, Put the caſe there be no ſuch veine of Miniſters as theſe, or however, none whom they can looke upon as ſuch, within their territories; what ſhift ſhall they then make for ſuch an addreſſe?</p>
            <p>Secondly, If they themſelves be uncapable (which is the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition now argued upon, and it hath been proved, that general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they are uncapable) of diſcerning between Truth and <hi>errour</hi> in <hi>questions,</hi> and matters of doubtfull diſputation in Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; how ſhall they be able to know, or ſatisfy themſelves, who are faithfull and orthodox, and who not? He that cannot judge what is erour, and what is truth, cannot determine what men or Miniſters are Orthodox, and what not.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, In caſe the Miniſters living under the juriſdiction of the Magiſtrate, (th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe I mean who are reputed godly, faithfull, and orthodox) ſhall be divided in judgement among themſelves, and one part of them adjudge that for truth and orthodox do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which the other ſhall condemne for errour and Hereſie; (a caſe of daily occurrence) under which of theſe ſhadows ſhall the Magiſtrate repoſe with peace and ſafety? To ſay, that in this caſe he is bound to cleave unto the major vote or party amongſt them, and to ſmite, where they ſhall ſay ſmite, is (upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) either to ſay nothing, or elſe that which is extremely obnox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious. For firſt, what if they be equally divided? in this caſe a major vote is but a caſtle in the aire. Secondly, In caſe they be not equally divided; what if the judgement or conſcience of the Magiſtrate ſhall incline to the leſſer party, as conceiving their grounds and reaſons to be of more pregnancy and weight, then the other, and cannot concurre or go along with theſe? Thirdly, Take any ſociety, coporation, or company of men of what capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city ſoever, under Heaven; as well reaſon, as experience evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth, that the major part of them are ever the weaker in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and underſtanding; and that commonly it is found in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter meetings and conventions, that the elder ſerves the younger, I
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:159924:48"/>
meane, that matters are carryed and concluded againſt the ſenſe<note place="margin">Sect. 46.</note> of men of greateſt abilities and worth, when there is any diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of votes amongſt them. Fourthly, and laſtly, if the Magiſtrate be bound, in the caſe under conſideration, to cleave either to the one party or the other, whether the leſſer, or the greater, and to ſmite that with his ſword, as errour or Hereſie, which either of them adjudgeth for ſuch: he ſtands bound likewiſe to puniſh and ſmite with the ſword, that whole party of Miniſters, as errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Hereticall, whoſe judgement he rejecteth in the conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; though when he called them hereunto, he looked upon them as godly, orthodox, and faithfull. And if caſes of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhould frequently happen, I meane wherein the civill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate ſhall have occaſion to adviſe with his godly Miniſters, for his information about errours, and Hereſies, and theſe Miniſters be divided in their judgements about them; and the Magiſtrate be bound to puniſh errours and Hereſies with the ſword, which that interpretation of the Scripture in hand now oppoſed by us, impoſeth upon him as a duty; he ſhould ſtill, <hi>toties quoties,</hi> and from time to time, be bound in conſcience to deſtroy or moleſt one party of the godly Miniſters under him; and ſo ere long muſt needs make a ſad deſolation in his territories of ſuch men; Therefore.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, and laſtly, when the Apoſtle ſaith concerning the Magiſtrates, <hi>that he is the Miniſter of God, a Revenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evill, &amp;c.</hi> that indefinit expreſſion, <hi>him that doth evill,</hi> is not to be taken or underſtood univerſally, for <hi>whoſoever doth evill,</hi> after what manner, or in what kinde ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; but with limitation, <hi>pro ſubjecta materia.</hi> 1. for the <hi>doer</hi> of ſuch or of that kinde of <hi>evill,</hi> which appertaine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to the cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of the Magiſtrate, and whereof ordinary Magiſtrates, or Magiſtrates in generall, as well Heathen, as Chriſtian, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent judges, as all <hi>ſuch evill is,</hi> which is manifeſtly ſuch, and of a Politicall conſideration, as that which is contrary <hi>to the light and law of nature, as Whoredome, Adultery, Murder, Theft, Injuſtice, Sedition, Treaſon, &amp;c.</hi> that this is the true interpretation and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this Scripture, is further confirmed.</p>
            <p>Firſt, by the like expreſſions of frequent occurrence in the<note place="margin">Sect. 47.</note> Scriptures, <hi>viz.</hi> where indefinit, yea, and ſometimes univerſall,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:159924:49"/>
expreſſions, are uſed to ſignifie, not a ſimple or abſolute, but a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative<note place="margin">Sect. 48.</note> or reſtrained univerſalitie of things, <hi>i. e.</hi> either a vniverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of ſuch things, which are particularly treated of in thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, where theſe expreſſions are found; or of ſuch, whoſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures or conditions are reaſonably capable of thoſe things, which either are attributed to them, or injoyned concerning them, in ſuch expreſſions. As for example, God himſelf ſaith, Exod. 12. 48. that <hi>no uncircumciſed perſon ſhould eat of the paſſeover;</hi> Yet this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall or univerſall expreſſion, is not to be extended unto wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the daughters of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as if they were reſtrained hereby from eating the Paſſeover, becauſe they are <hi>perſons uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed;</hi> the reaſon is, becauſe the note or univerſality, NO, in the prohibition, <hi>NO uncircumciſed perſon ſhall eat, &amp;c.</hi> imports, not an abſolute, but onely a relative univerſality, <hi>viz.</hi> of all that kinde of <hi>uncircumciſed perſons,</hi> which the verſe ſpeakes of, which are <hi>males;</hi> who alſo are the onely <hi>perſons</hi> capable of <hi>circumciſion.</hi> So when the Apoſtle <hi>commanded</hi> the Theſſalonians, <hi>that if any would not worke, he ſhould not eat;</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">2 Theſſ. 3. 10.</note> his meaning was, not to forbid nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment or food to be given, either to ſicke or lunatique perſons, or to young children, or to any perſon whatſoever uncapable of working; but onely unto thoſe, who changed an ability of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, into idleneſſe, and ſtubbornly refuſed to labour in a calling. So in the Scripture in hand, when he ſaith indefinitly, that <hi>Rulers are not a terrour to good workes, but to evill;</hi> the word <hi>Rulers,</hi> doth not ſignifie <hi>ALL Rulers</hi> whatſoever, but onely ſuch, who rule according to the will of God: for otherwiſe, we know there are many <hi>Rulers,</hi> who act contrary to this rule or aſſertion of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, and are <hi>a Terrour, not to evill workes, but to good.</hi> In like manner, when the Apoſtle ſaith, that the Magiſtrate <hi>is the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of God, to execute wrath upon (or againſt) him that doth evill; by him that doth evill,</hi> it is no way neceſſary that he ſhould mean eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man without exception, who doth that which is evill in one kind or other, but onely every man that <hi>doth</hi> any ſuch <hi>evill,</hi> which is of a politicall cognizance, and proper for a Magiſtrate, as a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, to puniſh.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if by <hi>him that doth evill,</hi> in this Scripture were<note place="margin">Sect. 48.</note> meant, every man without exception <hi>that doth</hi> any kinde <hi>of evill;</hi> then ſhould the Magiſtrate be <hi>the Miniſter of God,</hi> and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:159924:49"/>
be injoyned by him by way of duty, to puniſh men for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving<note place="margin">Sect. 49.</note> 
               <hi>evill</hi> thoughts, for committing adultery in the heart, for coveting that which is another mans, without doing any thing outwardly which is <hi>evill,</hi> or injurious to him, &amp;c. For whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>doth</hi> any of theſe things, moſt certainely <hi>doth</hi> that which is <hi>evill:</hi> but if we ſhall ſuppoſe, that the Magiſtrate ſtands bound by his office to <hi>execute wrath,</hi> upon ſuch <hi>evill doers</hi> as theſe, we had need make them Gods indeed, and give them knowledge of the hearts of men, or elſe we ſhall make them little better then devills, by bringing the guilt of ſin, and of unfaithfulneſſe in their places upon their heads, without end.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If God ſhould require of the Magiſtrate to <hi>execute wrath</hi> upon ſpreaders of <hi>errors and hereſies as evill doers,</hi> he ſhould be <hi>an hard Maſter</hi> indeed, and think <hi>to gather, where hee hath not ſtrewed, and to reap, where he hath not ſown</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 25. 24.</note>. For doubtleſſe, he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath given, nor doth give any ſufficiency of means to diſcern between <hi>Hereſie</hi> and ſound Doctrine, between <hi>Error</hi> and Truth, (at leaſt in many points in Chriſtian Religion) to one Magiſtrate of an hundred; I might (I beleeve) keep within the compaſſe of Truth, and ſay, of a thouſand. Eſpecially, if wee ſhall look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe Magiſtrates which were then in being in the world, when this Scripture was written; and upon occaſion of whoſe power <hi>to execute wrath upon him that doth evill,</hi> this admonition was given by the Apoſtle unto the <hi>Romans,</hi> it will clearely bee found, that they generally were ſo farre from being able to judge what was <hi>Error</hi> and <hi>Hereſie,</hi> what Truth and Orthodox, in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, that they judged this Religion it ſelfe, to be the grand <hi>Error and Hereſie</hi> of the world.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That by <hi>him that doth evill</hi> (in the clauſe under de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate)<note place="margin">Sect. 49.</note> the Apoſtle doth not mean, ſpreaders of <hi>Errors</hi> or <hi>Hereſies</hi> in Chriſtian Religion, but onely the actours of ſuch impieties, which were known to be ſuch, by the heathen Magiſtrates, who then bare rule over them, is evident from the context it ſelf, and the import of the ſame expreſſion in the former part of the ſame verſe, which is this. <hi>For he</hi> (the Magiſtrate) <hi>is the Miniſter of God to thee for thy good. But if thou ſhalt DOE THAT WHICH IS EVILL, be afraid: for hee beareth not the ſword in vain. By doing that which is evill</hi> in this paſſage, cannot
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:159924:50"/>
be meant, <hi>the ſpreading of Errors or Hereſies;</hi> becauſe they had not<note place="margin">Sect. 50.</note> ſo much reaſon of being <hi>afraid</hi> of the Magiſtrate here ſpoken of, for ſpreading of theſe, as for <hi>publiſhing or preaching</hi> the moſt Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Truths of Chriſtianity. They might without any danger at all from the Magiſtrate here ſpoken of, have publiſhed and taught, that the Idols which the <hi>Romans</hi> worſhipped, were true Gods; that the worſhip of Chriſtians, that Jeſus Chriſt was a deceiver, and not the Son of God, with twenty ſuch abominable errors and blaſphemies more. They had ten times more cauſe to bee <hi>afraid of the powers</hi> that now were, for publiſhing the moſt Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Truths, as that there is but one God, that the Gods of the <hi>Romans</hi> were either dumb Idols, or ſpeaking Devils; that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is the naturall Son of God, and onely Saviour of the world, &amp;c. Therefore, by that <hi>evill,</hi> upon the doing of which they had cauſe to be afraid of the Roman <hi>powers</hi> or Magiſtracy, the Apoſtle onely meanes ſuch wicked acts or practices, which they were apt to puniſh and take vengeance on, as apprehending them prejudiciall or deſtructive to the peace, ſafety, or wellfare of their ſtate; and not any <hi>publiſhing or ſpreading of errors or he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies,</hi> of the <hi>evill</hi> whereof they were wholly uncapable.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, That <hi>doing of evill,</hi> againſt which the Magiſtrate here<note place="margin">Sect. 50.</note> ſpoken of, is <hi>the Miniſter of God to execute wrath,</hi> is oppoſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that <hi>ſubjection to the higher powers,</hi> (injoyned in the firſt verſe) and of the ſame conſideration with the <hi>reſiſting of theſe powers,</hi> ſo ſharply reproved and threatned, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. From whence it clearly appeares, that by it is onely meant the <hi>doing</hi> of ſuch <hi>evill,</hi> which was prohibited by the Roman Laws and Edicts <note n="*" place="margin">Quod bonum eſt facito, hoc eſt, legibus obtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perato.

For no man can be ſaid, either to refuſe ſubjection unto, or to <hi>reſiſt the powers,</hi> under which he lives, who lives in an orderly ſubjection and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience unto all their Laws. Now certain it is, that neither the Roman Emperour or Senate in theſe dayes, had enacted any law againſt the <hi>publiſhing of Errors or Hereſies,</hi> in Chriſtian Religion. Therefore the publiſhing of theſe could be no branch or part of that <hi>evill,</hi> by the <hi>doing</hi> whereof the Roman powers ſhould have been <hi>reſiſted</hi> in their Laws.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, and laſtly, That <hi>doing of evill,</hi> againſt which the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate is ſaid to be <hi>the Miniſter of God to execute wrath, ver.</hi> 4. is
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:159924:50"/>

                  </gap>.</hi> Now certainly that <hi>doing of good,</hi> for which the Apoſtle undertakes that they ſhall <hi>have praiſe</hi> from the Roman Magiſtrate, was not the preaching or publiſhing of the great and orthodox truths of Chriſtian Religion, of the goodneſſe of which ſervice they were wholy inſenſible, yea, rather enemies unto it (as hath been ſaid) therefore, by that <hi>doing of evill,</hi> which is oppoſite hereunto, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be meant the <hi>ſpreading of Errors and Hereſies;</hi> but onely the perpetration of ſuch morall impieties, of the evill whereof to their ſtate and well-fare, they were fully ſenſible. Thus we have ſufficiently, and by the cleareſt evidence of the Scriptures them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, vindicated the Scripture-paſſage in hand, from that hand of violence, which goeth about to force it upon a bloudy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; yea, and to draw the Magiſtrate by it into a dangerous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, (far above his abilities and ſtrength) onely to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the ſecular deſignes of Eccleſiaſticall men. O England, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, make much of thy Scriptures, but take heed of the gloſſes of thy Teachers.

the opinion maintained in the book <hi>De ſervo Arbitrio,</hi> and joyned<note place="margin">Sect. 53.</note> with <hi>Eraſmus</hi> in his judgment, for the freedom of the will. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the improbability that <hi>Luther</hi> himſelfe alſo ſhould have now declin'd it, is not ſo great. Laſtly, the generality of our late Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant writers, who in their judgements generally are more <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vins</hi> then <hi>Luthers,</hi> doe generally<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upon occaſion, charge the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans,</hi> or followers of <hi>Luther,</hi> with unſound opinions, about <hi>Free-will and Election.</hi> So that it is every wayes probable, (at leaſt) that <hi>Luther</hi> himſelf was peccant, (as peccancy in this kind is now called) in his judgement about theſe points. But be it ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo, or otherwiſe, <hi>the witneſſe</hi> of his ſaid book <hi>De Servo arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trio,</hi> is but a ſlim proofe, that it was not ſo.

            </p>
            <p>So then, by the way, they grant, that the Civill Magiſtrate, under whom <hi>Luther</hi> lived, was defective in his duty towards God, that he did not put his great Embaſſadour and moſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſervant <hi>Luther</hi> into priſon, and there keep him faſt from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the devill any more harme all his dayes.

And for matter of <hi>danger,</hi> I would gladly learn from theſe Grandees, what difference there is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween holding the <hi>Error of Conſubſtantiation,</hi> and, <hi>that Chriſt is not aſcended into Heaven bodily,</hi> (which latter is one of the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons threatned by the Ordinance with death?) But</p>
            <p>Thirdly, and laſtly, this Anſwer goeth out in this ſnuffe. <hi>The</hi>

               <hi>opinions which he and others held which were erroneous, were in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Reformation, when thre had not been ſuch means of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, nor ſuch a cleering or ſetling of Truth, as there is amongſt us, aſpecially in the fundamentall Doctrines, &amp;c.</hi> But</p>
            <p>Firſt, why were there not <hi>ſuch meanes of conviction in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Reformation, as there is now amongſt us?</hi> Certain, I am, that there was as much learning, and as much labour, and as much conſcience and faithfullneſſe, in and about the <hi>beginning of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi> in very many of thoſe perſons whom God intereſſed in this honourable ſervice, as there is <hi>amongſt us.

Is it a <hi>juſt</hi> or righteous thing to <hi>beleeve,</hi> or to ſuppoſe, that a man of worth, of able parts, of eminent learning, of a compoſed judgement, of a tender conſcience, would baulk with God and his own ſoule, in ſhunning to declare, what upon mature ſtudie, upon diligent and faithfull inquirie, he judgeth to be the counſell or will of God, thorough feare of an Ordinance or Law in a civill State? <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve if</hi> Calvin <hi>were now alive,</hi> whether <hi>in this Kingdome,</hi> or in any other, he would conne theſe Gentlemen ſmall thankes for ſuch a commendation.</p>
            <p>The dregs ſetled in the bottome of this Anſwer, are theſe: <hi>can it be leſſe then a wilfull ſlaunder, and malicious purpoſe of rendring the Ordinance</hi> odious, <hi>to name death as a puniſhment for maintaining any thing against the Ordinances and Lawes about the Lords day, &amp;c.

            <p>In their Anſwer to their twelfth Argument, if they meane as<note place="margin">Sect. 56.</note> they ſay, they make ſome part of atonement for their delinquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy againſt the Queries hitherto. For here they grant, that <hi>no man is puniſhable for his meere miſtake, whatever his opinion be: but for being ſo pertinacious in his miſtake in matters of great conſequence, as that he will not forbeare to publiſh his miſtakes to the infection of others,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:159924:55"/>

            </p>
            <p>I freely acknowledge that whoſoever, out of <hi>pertinacy in his miſtake,</hi> not onely in <hi>matters of greater conſequence,</hi> but even of leſſer, <hi>will not forbeare to publiſh his miſtakes, to the infection of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, &amp;c. i. e.</hi> with a deſire or intention <hi>to infect, and miſchiefe the ſoules of others, &amp;c.</hi> deſerves ſeverely to be puniſhed; nor ſhall I ever plead mercy for ſuch a man. If the Ordinance had explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it ſelf after any ſuch manner as this, I (I preſume with many others) ſhould have been ſatisfied in it, without any more adoe; and not have needed to crave ſatisfaction about it, as now wee have done. But in caſe any man ſhall really and conſcientiouſly judge that opinion of his, which others call a <hi>miſtake,</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps is ſo indeed, to be a truth of God; and ſhall withall really judge, that he is bound in conſcience to hold forth ſuch an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion as being in his judgement and conſcience the undoubted truth of God; and withall neceſſary to be publiſhed and made known unto men, for their ſpirituall benefit and good; in caſe (I ſay) the <hi>publiſhing</hi> of his opinion or <hi>miſtake,</hi> upon ſuch termes as theſe, ſhall prove the <hi>infection of others,</hi> or inconvenience, or (if you will) <hi>miſchiefe the ſoules of others, &amp;c.</hi> I have no ground either in Reaſon, or Religion, to judge this man <hi>worthy, either death or bands.</hi> Nay, if to <hi>publiſh ſuch miſtakes,</hi> and that even with <hi>pertinacy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> which tend to <hi>the infection of others, and miſchiefe of ſoules, &amp;c.</hi> were a matter <hi>worthy either death, or bands,</hi> I have ſufficient grounds both in Reaſon and Religion, to judge and think, that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many Miniſters of the Anti-Independent intereſt, yea, many of very eminent repute amongſt them, would upon due examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and triall, be found in the condemnation.</p>
            <p>The ſtrength of their Anſwer to their thirteenth Argument,<note place="margin">Sect. 57.</note> leanes upon this ſtaffe: <hi>That the open and publique profeſſion of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, is more pernicious, then the practiſe of ſins in a like kinde and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree:</hi> they inſtance, <hi>To teach there is no Chriſt, is more dangerous</hi> (they ſay) <hi>then to live as if there were no Chriſt, and yet make a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of him.</hi> Well, but my judgement (and the judgements I beleeve of many more) and this Doctrine, are at oddes. But theſe men attempt a reconciliation by the mediation of this reaſon, for the proofe of their Doctrine. <hi>The one</hi> (they mean, <hi>the publique pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:159924:55"/>
of errours) juſtifieth what it doth, as lawfull, under pretended</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sect. 57.</note> 
               <hi>grounds of truth: The other practiſeth, and yet POSSIBLY not ſo impudently as to juſtifie his own practiſe:</hi> But</p>
            <p>Firſt, may not a man as <hi>poſſibly, publiquely profeſſe an error,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe then <hi>under pretended grounds of Truth,</hi> as <hi>practiſe,</hi> or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit <hi>ſin,</hi> without a <hi>justification of what he practiſeth?</hi> Certainely, he that practiſeth a ſin, hath the ſame <hi>neceſſity</hi> lying upon him to <hi>juſtifie</hi> what he doth; which he, who <hi>publiquely profeſſeth an error,</hi> hath to juſtifie this practiſe of his. Nor can I underſtand, why, or upon what ground, our Anti-Queriſts ſhould make any ſuch oppoſition, between a <hi>profeſſing of errour, and practiſing of ſinne.</hi> Is it their ſenſe, that a <hi>publike profeſſion of error, is no practiſing of ſin?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, when they ſay, by way of oppoſition to him that <hi>publiquely profeſſeth an errour,</hi> that he that <hi>practiſeth ſinne, may yet poſſibly doe it not ſo impudently as to juſtify his owne practiſe;</hi> do they not plainly ſuppoſe, firſt, that he that <hi>practiſeth</hi> ſinne, may <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe</hi> it upon ſuch tearms, <hi>viz.</hi> ſo, as to <hi>juſtify</hi> his <hi>practiſe</hi> (which ſuppoſition of theirs, I confeſſe, is atteſted for truth, by daily examples of <hi>Practitioners</hi> in this kind) and ſecondly, that when men doe thus <hi>practiſe,</hi> the <hi>practiſe</hi> of ſinne is every-whit <hi>as perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,</hi> as the <hi>publique profeſſing of an errour.</hi> And if ſo, doth not the reaſon which they bring to plead the cauſe of their aſſertion, prevaricate with it; and ſet up that which is contradictory to it, in its ſtead. But this is no news, amongſt thoſe, who think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves too good to ſubject unto the truth. But</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the queſtion is not, which of the two, a <hi>publique pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of errour,</hi> or <hi>the practice of ſin in a like kinde, &amp;c. be more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious;</hi> but which of them is more puniſhable, which deſerves the greater puniſhment? For in many caſes, practices or actions that are more pernicious, <hi>i. e.</hi> more prejudiciall and hurtfull unto others, may deſerve leſſe puniſhment, then ſome others which are leſſe hurtfull. The fact of a mad man, who in the heat of his diſtemper ſhall fall foule upon a man, and dangerouſly wound him, is more hurtfull unto him, then the fact of him that ſhall fairly take his purſe upon the high-way, or cheat him of a parcell of his money. But either of theſe latter facts is more pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhable then the former. Many inſtances, more of like conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might be added. Therefore,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:159924:56"/>Fourthly and laſtly, as to the aſſertion or concluſion it ſelfe;<note place="margin">Sect. 58</note> that <hi>the publique profeſſion of errour, is more pernicious then the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of ſinne, &amp;c.</hi> (if by <hi>pernicious,</hi> the aſſertors mean, <hi>puniſhable;</hi> which they muſt mean, if they ſpeake any thing to the purpoſe) the truth, or errour of the compariſon, will be cleerly tried by this touch-ſtone. <hi>If the open and publique profeſſion of errour,</hi> hath firſt more of the will in it, be more voluntary: Secondly, if it be more againſt the light, and law of nature; and then, Thirdly, and laſtly, if it be more <hi>pernicious</hi> (as they ſpeake) or miſchievous unto men, then the <hi>practice of ſinne in a like kinde and degree;</hi> then have theſe men judged righteouſly between them; <hi>the publique profeſſion of errour is more puniſhable, then the practice of ſinne, &amp;c.</hi> But if all things be found contrary between them, and <hi>the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of ſin in a like kind or degree,</hi> be firſt more voluntary; &amp; ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more repugnant to the light and law of nature; and Thirdly, of an equally, or a more, pernicious and dangerous conſequence, then the <hi>publique profeſſion,</hi> or holding forth <hi>of an errour;</hi> then have theſe men (it is much to be feared) taken a bribe, which hath <hi>blinded their eyes,</hi> and cauſed them to ſtumble in judgement. Now concerning the two former, there is little queſtion to be made, but that they are more ranke in ſuch a <hi>practicing of ſinne,</hi> as they put in the compariſon, <hi>as</hi> (for example) <hi>in living as if there were no Chriſt,</hi> then in <hi>profeſſing an error,</hi> as, viz. <hi>that there is no Christ.</hi> For firſt, that which is done contrary to that knowledge which a man hath, of what he ought to doe, cannot reaſonably be thought, but to have more of the will in it, then what is done out of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or with a concurrence of the judgement of the doer. Now men may <hi>profeſſe that there is no Christ,</hi> with a perfect concurrence of their judgement: for they may verily thinke that there is no ſuch perſon, as many thouſands in the world doe: (yea, it can hardly be ſuppoſed with any good conſiſtence in reaſon, that any man ever did, or will <hi>profeſſe that there is no Chriſt,</hi> who doth not really and inwardly judge ſo) but they cannot practice or live in Adultery, Murther, Theft, Oppreſſion, Deceit, &amp;c. (which is to live <hi>as if there were no Chriſt</hi>) but they muſt needs oppoſe their judgements, and conſciences, with the ſtrength of their wills. Secondly, the ſinnes mentioned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Adultery, Theft, &amp;c. are cleerly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and at firſt ſight againſt <hi>the light and law of nature;</hi> but the deniall
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:159924:56"/>
of the being of ſuch a perſon as Chriſt, who is both God and<note place="margin">Sect. 58.</note> man, is not contrary to any law or principle in nature; at leaſt to none, that is cleerly ſuch. Thirdly and laſtly, for the degree of danger, or <hi>perniciouſneſſe</hi> in either; (though the puniſhableneſſe of a practice is not, as hath been ſaid, ſo much to be meaſured by this) I conceive the <hi>practice of the ſinns,</hi> to be <hi>equally pernicious</hi> (at leaſt) with the <hi>profeſſion of the errour.</hi> The degree of <hi>perniciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> in a practice, is to be judged by theſe two things: firſt, by the degree of the evill, which it is like to produce, or poſſibly may produce. Secondly, by the degree of the likelyhood in it to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce this evill. That which poſſibly may occaſion or produce a greater evill then another, is not neceſſarily the more <hi>pernicious;</hi> except there be a proportionable likelyhood that it will produce it. Nor is that neceſſarily the more <hi>pernicious,</hi> which is the more likely to occaſion or produce evill; unleſſe the degree of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, which it is likely to occaſion, be thereafter. But when the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill or <hi>miſchiefe</hi> which two ſeverall practices poſſibly may or are likely to produce, is one and the ſame; then that is cleerly the more pernicious, which is the more likely to produce this evill. Firſt then it is cleer, <hi>that to live as if there were no Chriſt,</hi> may ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry poſſibly occaſion men to thinke, that indeed <hi>there is no Chriſt,</hi> as well as to profeſſe in words, <hi>that there is no Chriſt.</hi> So that in reſpect of the evill (at leaſt in that particular, which is now in conſideration) which both the one and the other may produce; there is no difference between the two practices. If then there be as great a likelyhood, that <hi>to live as if there were no Chriſt,</hi> (as <hi>viz.</hi> in Adultery, Theft, Deceit, &amp;c.) will produce the evill men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, as to <hi>profeſſe</hi> in words, that <hi>there is no Chriſt;</hi> then is the former every-whit as <hi>pernicious,</hi> as the latter. The degree of a likelyhood to produce evill (in that kinde we ſpeake of) is to be eſtimated by ſome ſuch rule as this; that which is as apt or likely to corrupt the mindes or judgements of men, with the evill of the errour, hath the ſame likelyhood in it to produce the evill: and that which hath the greater aptneſſe in this kinde, hath the greater likel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hood. Now that method or meanes of corrupting the mindes of men with errours, which is more plauſible and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and more complying with the fleſh, is more apt and likely to produce the evill, then another, which is leſſe plauſible and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:159924:57"/>
tempting in this kinde. If ſo, then for men to live as <hi>if there were</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sect. 59.</note> 
               <hi>no Chriſt,</hi> is more <hi>pernicious,</hi> and likely <hi>to miſchiefe the ſoules of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> then to ſay, or <hi>profeſſe</hi> in Words <hi>that there is no Christ.</hi> For firſt, examples, are more inſinuating, and tempting, and apt to gaine upon men, then doctrines, or bare aſſertions, or argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of things are, <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeakes of ſome <hi>husbands,</hi> who <hi>may be won by the converſation of the wives,</hi> when they cannot be gained <hi>by the word</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 1.</note>. And if examples on the right hand be more opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and perſwaſive in this kinde, then doctrines of the ſame kinde; certainly examples on the left hand, are not behinde. He ſpake both reaſon and experience, who ſaid:

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, this great errour, <hi>that there is no Chriſt,</hi> being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented<note place="margin">Sect. 59.</note> and recommended to the ſenſuall hearts of men for a truth, with thoſe ſenſuall accommodations of preſent pleaſures and profites (as it is in the example of Adultery, Drunkenneſſe, Deceit, &amp;c.) comes upon tearms of more advantage to gaine en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment with men, then when it comes onely in a ſound of words, or in the drie notion of a doctrine. Yea, the truth is, that the great errour we ſpeake of, <hi>that there is no Chriſt,</hi> would be of little, or no accommodation to the fleſh (and conſequently there would be no great danger of its infection) did it not contribute towards that peaceable liberty for the practiſe of ſinne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which the fleſh or ſenſuall part of men ſo ardently wiſheth and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth. Therefore when it commeth unto the ſoule viſibly attended and accompanied with that retinue of carnall gratifications, which it in part as well begetteth, as maintaineth; the very ſight and beholding of theſe, pleads, and procures acceptation for it, in the eyes of the carnall judgements, and fleſhly mindes of men, and awakens and invites the fooliſh heart to intertaine it.

            </p>
            <p>Their Anſwer to their fifteenth Argument is ſomewhat faint<note place="margin">Sect. 63.</note> and tender. They ſpeake here as if they cared not much whether they ſpake or no yet they take courage to ſay, that <hi>the publique holding of ſome opinions may be ſo prejudiciall to the publique peace, as may deſerve impriſonment, and yet not deſerve excommunication, &amp;c.</hi> But their ſtrength is wholy ſpent with bringing forth the bare aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, that they have not left wherewith to cloath or guard it with any proofe.

            <p>Whereas they adde, that the <hi>Apostle</hi> did not call them <hi>beloved Brethren,</hi> that <hi>at Corinth denyed the reſurrection, but the reſt of the Church that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ld the Truth;</hi> except either they will ſay, that they ſpeake it by Revelation, or elſe give ſome, either Scripture, or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to prove it; I truſt they will give us leave to judge it Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phall, and to number it amongſt the tranſgreſſions of their pen. That which followes, is yet of a more ignoble calculation: for they ſay, <hi>neither were there any ſuch in the Church of Corinth, or Christian Churches then, that held opinions of farre worſe conſequence, then very many, or even then any of thoſe errours, which the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance threatens with death.</hi> But firſt, why, or in relation whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, doe they tell us this ſtory? would they have their Reader thinke, that in ſaying this (though they could prove it, which they neither doe, nor, I beleeve, can) they anſwer the demand of the Querie? They that are willing to be deceived<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may ſo judge. But the Querie doth not aske, <hi>whether there were not in the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who publiquely held ſome opinions of worſe conſequence, then many of thoſe</hi> which the Ordinance <hi>threatens with death;</hi> but, then many of thoſe which this <hi>Ordinance threatens, either with impriſonment, or death.</hi> But when a ſhadow will doe the deed, what need men take care for the ſubſtance? and when halfe anſwers will ſerve the turne, ſuch as are compleat and whole are but ſuperfluities. Secondly, for my ſatisfaction about the truth of the aſſertion, I deſire to conſult the learning and judgements, and conſciences of theſe men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whether this opinion, that <hi>the bodyes of men ſhall not riſe againe after death,</hi> which they know was held in the Church of Corinth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> againe, whether the denying of juſtification to be by Chriſt alone, which they know was intertained by many in the Churches of Galatia; yet againe, whether to deny <hi>that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh,</hi> which it ſeems from 2 <hi>Joh. v.</hi> 7. was the opinion and doctrine of <hi>many</hi> in theſe times; whether I ſay every of theſe opinions, eſpecially the ſecond, be not <hi>of worſe conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,</hi> and more deſtructive to the eternall ſalvation of men, then this, <hi>that there is no day of judgement after death;</hi> which yet is

one of the <hi>errours threatened with death by the Ordinance?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sect. 64.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Their Sxteenth Argument (ſo called) is fraudulently made, and drawn up quite beſides the tenour and import of the Querie;<note place="margin">Sect. 64.</note> and therefore though I cannot undertake ſimply for the juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, yet is it much more righteous then the Anſwer made to it: For<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, this affirmeth, that <hi>thoſe who hold and publiquely maintain any of the opinions, puniſhable by death in the Ordinance, cannot be ſo full of grace and goodneſſe as thoſe of a contrary judgement.</hi> An aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (doubtleſſe) no wayes reconcileable with any ſound princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, either in reaſon or Religion. Yet our Anti-Querie-men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the patronage and defence of it, by this plea: <hi>Becauſe</hi> (ſay they) <hi>they</hi> who <hi>h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ld, and publiquely maintain DAMNA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BLE hereſies, have no true Grace, or goodneſſe at all.</hi> But (for Anſwer to this) I would know of theſe men, what they mean, by <hi>DAMNABLE Hereſies?</hi> For I feare they ſpread a net in the darkneſſe of this word, <hi>DAMNABLE,</hi> to deceive their ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ones<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If by <hi>DAMNABLE,</hi> they mean that, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies and inevitably accompanied with eternall <hi>Damnation,</hi> there is truth in their reaſon, but no pertinency at all to their purpoſe; unleſſe they be <hi>ſtronger then God,</hi> and can doe impoſſibilities: as (particularly) prove, that all <hi>the opinions puniſhable by death in the Ordinance,</hi> are <hi>DAMNABLE</hi> in ſuch a ſenſe, <hi>i. e.</hi> of an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute inconſiſtence with Grace, and forgiveneſſe of ſin by God. I feare their touchſtone, whereby they try opinions and hereſies whether they be <hi>DAMNABLE</hi> in this ſenſe, or no<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is but coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit and naught, and doth but abuſe them, and many more with them. Yet if they will pleaſe to give it a name by which we may know it, we ſhall be the better able to examine and judge of it. For my part, I verily beleeve, that there are very few o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions or hereſies (as ſome men call Hereſie) which are <hi>DAM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NABLE</hi> in this ſenſe. My reaſon is, becauſe the Scripture ſo expreſſely ſaith, <hi>That whoſoever beleeveth in Jeſus Chriſt, ſhall not periſh, but have everlaſting life.</hi> And if there be no opinion ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely inconſiſtent with ſuch a beleeving<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but onely that, which is either formally, or vertually, contradictory to it; Certain I am, that there are not many <hi>DAMNABLE</hi> in the ſenſe now argued upon. Yea, I make much queſtion, whether all opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:159924:60"/>
which are onely vertually and by way of implication, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory<note place="margin">Sect. 65.</note> thereunto, be abſolutely inconſiſtent with this belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; and conſequently <hi>DAMNABLE</hi> (in the ſaid ſenſe.) But if by <hi>DAMNABLE Hereſies,</hi> they onely meane, ſuch opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions or errors, which are of dangerous conſequence (eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if they who hold them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhould withall hold all other Errours, which in a conſequentiall way depend upon them) and in this reſpect are juſtly and deeply <hi>condemnable,</hi> or cenſurable by men; their reaſon vaniſheth into nothing, for want of truth in it. For many who hold and publiquely maintain <hi>DAMNABLE He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies,</hi> in this ſenſe, may have, yea and ſome (as farre as men are able to diſcerne) <hi>defacto, have true Grace and goodneſſe,</hi> (as hath been formerly aſſerted in this Diſcourſe) and might be inſtanced in many more. But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, That which follows in this Anſwer, is of a far weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er<note place="margin">Sect. 65.</note> conſtitution, then that which went before. For here they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that they <hi>that hold any of the other opinions puniſhable by the Ordinance, cannot be ſo full of grace and goodneſſe, as they MAY BE who are of a contrary judgement.</hi> But</p>
            <p>Firſt, The Querie doth not make any ſuch ridiculous demand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whether <hi>thoſe that are of a contrary judgement MAY NOT be as full of Grace and goodneſſe,</hi> as thoſe that hold the opinions made obnoxious by the Ordinance. But the purport of the Querie is this: <hi>Whether it be not poſſible, that theſe (viz.</hi> taken in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent condition, with all their infirmities, whether in point of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, or practiſe) <hi>may be as full of Grace and goodneſſe,</hi> as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? (<hi>viz.</hi> taken and conſidered likewiſe with their reſpective burtherns in both kinds, as for the preſent they walk laden with them.) Now compare the Gentlemens Anſwer (in the words mentioned) with the Queſtion put to them, and you will finde no more ſympathy between them, then is between Harp and Harrow.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Neither is there any whit more Truth, then perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency of relation, in the ſaid Aſſertion. For certainly they that <hi>hold ſome,</hi> yea, or all, <hi>the opinions puniſhable by the Ordinance,</hi> may be <hi>as full of Grace and goodneſſe,</hi> as they <hi>may be,</hi> who <hi>are of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary judgement, viz.</hi> if God will pleaſe to intereſſe his power for the cleanſing of the former from all filthineſſe, both of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:159924:61"/>
and practiſe, as well as of the latter. The <hi>Opinions puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sect. 66.</note> 
               <hi>by the Ordinance,</hi> are every whit as reduceable by the ſpirit of God, as the errours held and maintained by men of <hi>a contrary judgement:</hi> (for I ſuppoſe that they alſo have their errors, if they be men) and their perſons or ſoules likewiſe capable of as great inlargements for, and with Grace from the hand of God, as theirs.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Whereas they further here ſay, <hi>That thoſe who hold, and publiquely maintain any of thoſe Hereſies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cannot be ſo truely ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the State, as thoſe of a contrary judgement; becauſe that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they even provoke God againſt the State, by the diſhonour they bring to him, and the miſchiefe they doe to his people;</hi> Doe they ſuppoſe that <hi>thoſe of a contrary judgement,</hi> amongſt whom it is notoriouſly known, that there are fornicators, adulterers, drunkards, deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, covetous, oppreſſors, proud, perſecutors, &amp;c. Doe they ſuppoſe (I ſay) that ſuch abomination-workers as theſe, doe not at all <hi>provoke God againſt the State, or bring diſhonour to him, or do miſchiefe unto his people?</hi> For without ſuch a ſuppoſition as this, it is evident, that thoſe who maintain ſome one, yea, or more, of the <hi>hereſies</hi> (ſo called) or errors made <hi>puniſhable by the Ordinance,</hi> may be as <hi>truly ſerviceable to the State, as thoſe of contrary judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> yea, and this with the full conſent of that very reaſon, which is here brought to prove the contrary. Or doe theſe men conceive, that whoſoever will undergo the penance of bowing downe his neck to the yoke of high Presbytery, ſhall hereby ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine<note place="margin">Sect. 66.</note> a plenary remiſſion of all his ſinnes from God; yea, and<note place="margin">Do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In their eighteenth Anſwer, <hi>p.</hi> 20. pretending to anſwer an<note place="margin">Sect. 69.</note> Argument drawn from <hi>the parable of the tares,</hi> they ſay, that <hi>the parable doth not forbid to pluck up the tares in one field, for feare left others ſhould plucke up the wheat in another [field</hi>] In this doubtleſſe they ſpeake moſt truly. For Chriſt was not afraid, left <hi>the plucking up of the tares in this world,</hi> ſhould occaſion <hi>the plucking up of the wheat</hi> in the next world. For <hi>the field,</hi> wherein both <hi>the wheate and the tares are to grow together,</hi> is expreſly ſaid to be the <hi>world, i. e.</hi> this preſent world. <hi>The field is the world, Matth.</hi> 13. 38. So that our Antagoniſts thus farre, in the point in hand, ſpeake moſt ſubſtantially for matter of truth; but moſt childiſhly, as for matters of Anſwer, or reaſon otherwiſe. Whereas they
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:159924:62"/>
adde; that the parable <hi>forbids to pluck up the tares, when by the</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sect. 70.</note> 
               <hi>ſame act they may be in danger to pluck up the wheat with it;</hi> if they can be content to have a ſober ſenſe put upon their words, (a better, I beleeve, then their owne) I willingly ſubſcribe unto this alſo. For they, who by <hi>plucking up that,</hi> which they call <hi>tares,</hi> (and perhaps is ſo) in one part of the field, ſhall, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably may, occaſion or provoke others, to pluck up that, which they alſo call <hi>tares</hi> (and perhaps is not ſo, but <hi>good wheat</hi>) in another, may very properly be ſaid, by the <hi>ſame act to be in danger of plucking up the wheat alſo with it.</hi> And there is little queſtion (indeed) to be made, but that this was our Saviours expreſſe meaning in thoſe words: <hi>leſt while you gather up the tares, you pluck up alſo the wheat with them</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 13. 29.</note>. <hi>i. e, leſt</hi> by your example, in <hi>gathering out the tares</hi> in your part of the field<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or, where you have to doe, you occaſion or excite others to pluck up the wheat in that part of the field where they have to doe: which latter thing, if it ſhould be done, may juſtly be imputed to that act of yours in <hi>gathering or plucking up the tares.</hi> Our Saviour in this Parable expreſſeth himſelf to be ſo exceedingly tender of the lives and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of his Saints and faithfull ones (ſignified by the <hi>Wheat</hi>) that he prohibits the doing of ſuch an act, which otherwiſe, even his ſervants themſelves would judge moſt neceſſary to be done, chiefly becauſe he knew and foreſaw, that the doing of it would endanger theſe, I mean, the lives and liberties of many of his Saints, He declareth himſelf willing and deſirous, that rather ſome unworthy men ſhould be ſpared, then that their ſuffering ſhould occaſion the cauſeleſſe ſufferings of his Saints, But</p>
            <p>Secondly, When they ſay on, <hi>That the tares cannot be meant in</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sect. 70.</note> 
               <hi>that parable, ONELY of Heretiques or falſe Teachers;</hi> doe they not forget themſelves exceedingly, and give away the cauſe of high-Presbytery at once? He that ſhall ſay, that <hi>Abraham</hi> did not <hi>ONELY</hi> beget <hi>Iſaac,</hi> doth he not ſuppoſe and grant, that <hi>Abraham</hi> howſoever did beget <hi>Iſaac?</hi> So he that ſhall ſay, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> did not <hi>ONELY</hi> call <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Andrew</hi> to be Apoſtles, doth he not cleerly imply, that yet he <hi>called</hi> theſe, as well as others to that dignity? In like manner when our Counter-Queriſts ſay, that <hi>the tares in the parable cannot be meant ONELY of Heretiques and falſe Teachers,</hi> they plainly and fairely grant, that yet <hi>they
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:159924:63"/>
are meant</hi> of theſe, as well as of any other ſort of wicked men.<note place="margin">Sect. 71.</note> If ſo, then muſt not the <hi>Servants</hi> of Chriſt, whether Magiſtrates or Miniſters, <hi>gather them out from amongſt the wheat</hi> by death, but <hi>ſuffer them to grow together in the field, i. e.</hi> in the world, untill the great <hi>harveſt</hi> in the <hi>end of the world:</hi> that is, they are to leave them, as for matter of corporall puniſhment, to the proceeding of God himſelf againſt them at the great day. Therefore</p>
            <p>Thirdly, whereas they attempt to prove their ſaid aſſertion, by ſaying, <hi>that by our Saviours own Interpretation, they are ALL thoſe that in the field where the good ſeed is ſown, are the children of the wicked one,</hi> i. e. <hi>all thoſe who being ungodly in heart, doe manifeſt their ungodlineſſe to the view of others;</hi> they doe notoriouſly falſifie <hi>our Saviours Interpretation,</hi> and ſubſtitute that in the ſtead of it, which is not onely contrary to his meaning and word, but unto reaſon it ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea, and to the cleer ſenſe and minde of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures elſewhere. For</p>
            <p>Firſt, Our Saviour doth not ſay, that the <hi>tares, are ALL the</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sect 71.</note> 
               <hi>children of the wicked one;</hi> but indefinitely thus: <hi>The tares are the children of the wicked one</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 13. 38.</note>. Now indefinite propoſitions are not alwaies equipollent unto univerſals; but are to be conſtrued, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times as particulars, ſometimes as univerſalls, according to the nature of them, together with direction of other circumſtances, and aſſertions of the ſame Authors in which they are found.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That our Saviour by the <hi>tares,</hi> doth not mean univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally, <hi>ALL the children of the wicked one,</hi> is evident, becauſe he onely ſpeaks of ſuch <hi>tares</hi> which were ſown amongſt the <hi>wheat,</hi> (i. e. the children of the <hi>Kingdome,</hi> or of the Goſpell) and ſprang up together with it <note n="*" place="margin">Ver. 25. 26.</note>. Now there were, and are at this day, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly</hi> ones, and children of the <hi>wicked one,</hi> in ſuch parts or places of the <hi>field,</hi> where no <hi>wheat</hi> was ever ſown; I mean in ſuch parts of the world, where the <hi>word</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> (the Goſpel) was never preached.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the <hi>tares</hi> of which the Parable ſpeaketh, are ſaid to have been <hi>ſown by the envious man</hi> ſome time after the <hi>wheat</hi> was ſown. Therefore they cannot be meant, of <hi>ALL</hi> the <hi>children</hi> of the <hi>wicked one,</hi> or of <hi>ALL</hi> that are <hi>manifestly ungodly,</hi> becauſe there were great numbers of theſe in the <hi>field</hi> (the world) even at the time when the <hi>wheat</hi> was ſowne, and the world firſt plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:159924:63"/>
with <hi>the Children of the Kingdome:</hi> yea, and long before.<note place="margin">Sect. 72</note>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, If by the <hi>tares</hi> ſhould be meant <hi>ALL</hi> wicked and <hi>manifeſtly ungodly ones,</hi> then ought not theeves, murtherers, nor the moſt deſperate kinde of malefactors under Heaven, be cut off from the world by the ſword of the civill Magiſtrate, but be let alone in their reſpective wayes and practiſes of miſchiefe, untill the judgement of the great day. For our Saviour expreſly orders and enjoyns, that the <hi>tares,</hi> of which he ſpeakes in the parable, <hi>be ſuffered to grow together</hi> [with the wheat] <hi>untill the harveſt</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Matth. 13. 30</note>. If our Anti-Queriſts whoever they be, thus charge the <hi>master of the houſe,</hi> with the crime of Anti-Magiſtraticalliſme, it is no great matter if they charge <hi>thoſe of his houſhold</hi> with it much more.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, ſuch <hi>wicked and ungodly ones,</hi> and ſuch onely, are meant<note place="margin">Sect. 72.</note> by the <hi>tares</hi> in our Saviours parable, the taking away of whoſe lives, is like to endanger the lives of his Saints, <hi>the children of the Kingdome,</hi> and that more generally. <hi>But he ſaid, nay, leſt whilſt yee gather up the tares, yee pluck up alſo the wheat with them</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Ver. 29.</note>. Now the cutting of many <hi>manifeſtly ungodly</hi> and wicked ones, by the ſword of the Magiſtrate; as <hi>viz.</hi> Murtherers, Theeves, Traytors, &amp;c. doth no wayes endanger either the lives or liberties of the Saints, but rather is a preſervative and ſecurity and honour unto them. The reaſon is, becauſe theſe (the Saints) are generally <hi>kept by the power of God thorough Faith,</hi> as <hi>unto ſalvation;</hi> ſo from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petration and breaking out into ſuch horrid and vile practiſes, as theſe. Therefore when the actors of ſuch impieties as theſe, are puniſhed by the Magiſtrate, the innocency and unblameableneſſe of their wayes are ſet of with the greater luſtre and commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. So that</p>
            <p>Sixtly and laſtly, by the <hi>tares</hi> in the parable, <hi>according to our Saviours interpretation,</hi> is meant <hi>onely</hi> that veyne, or ſort of evill doers, who ſerve the Kingdome of Sathan by ſowing falſe Doctrines, by corrupting the purity of the Goſpell, as by ſprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Errours and Hereſies in the Churches of Chriſt amongſt the Saints, &amp;c. There are ſeverall circumſtances in the Parable, which cleerly reſtraines the ſenſe and interpretation of the <hi>tares</hi> to falſe Teachers, and ſpreaders of Errours and Hereſies. Firſt, falſe Teachers and corrupters of the purity of the Goſpell, were not found in the world, till ſome while after, that the Goſpell had
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:159924:64"/>
been purely and ſincerely taught in the world, (as the tares were<note place="margin">Sect. 73</note> not ſown, till ſome while after the ſowing of the wheat) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as there were evill-doers of all other kindes in abundance, at this time, and before (as hath been already ſaid.) There were indeed, falſe Teachers and corrupters of the truth in the Church of the Jews, before and at the time when the Goſpell was firſt publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in the world, ſuch were the Sadduces, Phariſes, &amp;c. and ſo there were Teachers of many vanities amongſt the Gentiles in many places. But the Goſpell cannot properly be ſaid to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with Errours or falſe Doctrines mingled with it; firſt, untill the Truth of it was declared and planted in the world: Nor ſecondly, by any, but by thoſe who profeſſe it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the <hi>tares appeared</hi> not, till after the <hi>blade</hi> of the wheat was ſprung up, yea, and had <hi>brought forth fruite</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 13. 26.</note>. Nor were there any falſe Teachers heard of, who corrupted the Truth of the Goſpell, untill the Apoſtles had planted the Goſpell in the purity of it, and made many proſelytes to it in the world, which our Saviour elſewhere (<hi>viz. Joh.</hi> 15. 16.) calleth a <hi>bringing forth fruite.</hi> But evill doers in other kindes there were as many (or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more) before the <hi>wheat had brought forth this fruite,</hi> as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, the enemy, or <hi>envious man,</hi> who is ſaid to have <hi>ſowne</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sect. 73.</note> 
               <hi>the tares, (the Devill) went his way,</hi> (as the parable ſaith) when he had done this worke; that is, he did it ſlily and covertly; he was not ſeen or obſerved when he did it, nor till ſome while after. Thoſe falſe Teachers who mingled Evangelicall Truth with Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and Hereſies, were not ſuſpected for ſuch at the firſt, no nor diſcerned at all by very many profeſſing Chriſtianity, either firſt or laſt, <hi>viz.</hi> all ſuch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who imbraced their errours, inſtead of truth, and continued in them. Whereas in Murthers, Thefts, Seditions, Rebellions, Treaſons, with many other kindes of impiety, Sathan is apparant, and to be ſeene (as it were) <hi>with open face.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, the <hi>gathering up</hi> of the <hi>tar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s,</hi> endangered the <hi>plucking up of the wheat alſo with them.</hi> In like manner, if Magiſtrates or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſhall be buſie about plucking up Sectaries, Heretiques, Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of Errours, &amp;c. they will be in continuall danger of <hi>pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the wheat alſo,</hi> I mean godly men, <hi>and children of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:159924:64"/>Firſt, becauſe many truly pious and conſcientious men, <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sect. 73.</note> 
               <hi>of the Kingdome,</hi> may eaſily bee drawn into ſome unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable Sect, or opinion. Secondly, ſuch opinions as expoſe thoſe who hold them forth, to the reproachfull names of Sectaries, Schiſmatiques, Heretiques, &amp;c. and in this reſpect ſhall be ſentenced, and proceeded againſt by the Magiſtrate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous and hereticall, may well be the ſacred Truths of God; and the perſons holding them forth unto the world, the beſt and faithfulleſt of his ſervants; Examples hereof were frequent in this very Kingdome in the dayes of Papall power. Thirdly, and laſtly, the very example of one kinde of Magiſtrate <hi>plucking up the tares,</hi> as he calls <hi>tares,</hi> in one place; is very likely to occaſion the like <hi>plucking</hi> up, by a Magiſtrate of another ſpirit in another place, of ſuch as he calls <hi>tares,</hi> who yet, very poſſibly, may be the <hi>good wheat.</hi> Whereas if we ſpeak of morall impieties and the workers of theſe, as Adulterers, Murtherers, Oppreſſors, Traitors, &amp;c. there is little or no danger, that the Saints (at leaſt, not any conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble numbers of them) ſhould ſuffer by any proceedings of the Magiſtrate againſt theſe, becauſe, Firſt, they are ſeldome given up to the committing of ſuch ſins as theſe. Secondly, becauſe, there are no other practiſes, whether righteous or unrighteous, that are any thing like unto theſe, or wherein there is ordinarily any place for a miſtake, by men of ordinary underſtanding. Thirdly, and laſtly, neither can the example of any one Magiſtrate, inflicting puniſhment upon offenders in any of theſe kindes, in reaſon or likelihood of event, occaſion another Magiſtrate of what ſpirit ſoever, to inflict puniſhment upon thoſe who are not offenders; in as much as all Magiſtrates are of one and the ſame judgement in this, that morall miſdemeanours, and particularly thoſe that were mentioned, with their like, ought to be puniſhed.</p>
            <p>Fifthly and laſtly, the <hi>tares</hi> are by the order and command of <hi>Chriſt, to be ſuffered to grow together with the wheat, untill the harveſt.</hi> But evident it is, that Chriſt would not have murthers, thefts, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulteries, and other morall miſdemeanors, to be left unpuniſhed by the Civill Magiſtrate untill the laſt day; becauſe then, he ſhould <hi>carry the ſword in vain,</hi> and not be <hi>Gods Miniſter to execute wrath upon ſuch as doe evill;</hi> and ſo the Office of Magiſtracy would be quite taken away by ſuch an interpretation. Therefore without

all controverſie, by the <hi>tares</hi> are preciſely and determinately<note place="margin">Sect. 74.</note> meant, falſe teachers, and ſpreaders of errors in Religion (and yet not all theſe neither, though now we have not time to diſtinguiſh) whom the Magiſtrate may ſuffer to <hi>grow with the wheat unto the harveſt,</hi> and yet have work enough for his <hi>ſword,</hi> and his Office ſtand in full force, ſtrength, and vertue, for the benefit and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation of the world.</p>
            <p>But our Anti-Queriſts perceiving this Parable comming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt<note place="margin">Sect. 74.</note> them and their bloody Tenet, <hi>like an armed man,</hi> againſt whom no reſiſtance is to be made, they wiſely ſeek to divert the courſe of it another way; and fain would perſwade the world, <hi>that the ſcope of it rather relates to the providence of God in the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of Angels, then to the duty of the Magiſtrate</hi> (this certainly is a <hi>new light hung out by the Gentlemen</hi> Presbyterians.) And becauſe they could not much confide in ſuch an empty ſpeculation as this, or think that it would ever paſſe the judgements of men with ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation; therefore through feare they betake themſelves to the refuge of this darkneſſe: <hi>That there is ſome obſcurity in all parables to make them ſute.</hi> And becauſe they would not willingly be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed in their way, by this or any other <hi>Parable,</hi> therefore they further give this prudent admonition to their Adverſaries concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Parables, that <hi>they are not to be urged beyond their ſcope;</hi> which they would have both them and all the world to preſume, is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to hurt or to indanger High-Presbytery. Which alſo (in effect) they confeſſe, in the words following; which (the errors, either of their preſſe, or pen, or both, corrected with as much skill and faithfulneſſe as I can) are theſe: <hi>The ſcope of which Parable, that it is not to ſhew the Magiſtrates duty, may appeare further by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours interpretation and making no application, or</hi> [ſhewing] <hi>what men ſhould doe here in ſparing any wicked man, but ſhewing what God will doe at the day of judgement, as is MANIFEST to any that will read Chriſts interpretation of it.</hi> It ſeems then, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome obſcurity in the Parable, yet there is ſome light alſo in it. <hi>For whatſoever maketh MANIFEST is light.</hi> And the truth is, that there is more obſcurity in theſe few lines of theirs, then is in all the Parable they ſpeak of. For they tell us twice over (for failing) of <hi>Chriſts Interpretation</hi> of the Parable; and yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that he makes any <hi>application.</hi> For my part I underſtand not
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:159924:65"/>
how any man can make an <hi>interpretation</hi> of a Parable, without<note place="margin">Sect. 75.</note> making ſome <hi>application</hi> or other. If their meaning be, that Chriſt in his <hi>Interpretation</hi> of it, did not apply it to the <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> or ſpeak of his duty in <hi>ſparing any wicked man,</hi> (which they ſeeme brokenly to imply.)</p>
            <p>I Anſwer, It is not neceſſary for the opening or interpretation of a Parable, to interpret or apply every particularity contained in it, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or in expreſſeneſſe of words: it is ſufficient, if ſuch and ſo many particulars of it be interpreted, or applyed; by the underſtanding whereof other particulars alſo, and conſequently the whole Parable, may be underſtood. Now certain it is, that <hi>Christ</hi> hath ſo farre interpreted the Parable of the <hi>tares, and made application</hi> of ſo many of the particulars in it, that the reſidue of it may by the light of the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The former part of their Anſwer to the Argument under pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.<note place="margin">Sect. 75.</note> conſiſting of the greateſt part of their twentieth page, hath been fully anſwered in what hath been replyed to the latter: From whence alſo it cleerly appears, that the whole tenour and carriage of it, lies quite beſides the ſpirit, drift, and ſcope of the Querie. The ſcope of this, was not to ask, whether any man ought to neglect a duty, for feare of any inconvenience, one, or more, greater or leſſer, that may poſſibly attend the performance (which is all that this part of the Anſwer maketh at) but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch an act or practiſe as is there mentioned, be not likely to to produce that inconvenience or evill, for the prevention wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the Lord Chriſt hath declared himſelfe againſt the practiſe.</p>

            <p>Firſt, what manner of monſtrous beaſt is this unhappy <hi>minor,</hi> which thus affrights theſe men out of their Chriſtian wits? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſſe! it is but this innocent Lamb, (whether mine or theirs.) <hi>The Ordinance in queſtion, is apparently bent againſt the faces, if not of the moſt, yet of a very conſiderable part of the beſt and moſt conſcientious men amongſt us.</hi> Well, it ſeems this Lamb muſt make a ſacrifice: but how, or with what knife doe the Prieſts ſlay it? with this: <hi>It is falſe,</hi> the Ordinance <hi>is onely bent againſt Heretiques and Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers and other erroneous ſpirits, who will needs, notwithſtanding any admonition, publiſh doctrines that are hurtfull to mens ſoules, and the peace of the Church and State.</hi> But is not the Lamb yet alive for all this ſtroke given unto it? Or is not the bare affirmation of the <hi>minor</hi> thus ſtruck at, as Authoritative and Authentique, as the bare negation of the Anſwer? If the Anti-Queriſts know any ſuch difference between themſelves and the Queriſt, that all his ſayings muſt needs be <hi>hay and ſtubble,</hi> and all theirs <hi>ſilver and gold,</hi> they ſhall doe well to informe him of it. He ſhall preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, upon the information, if it be competent, make all his ſayings to become homagers unto theirs. But with as much confidence as they ſeem to rejoyce againſt the poore <hi>minor,</hi> as being <hi>falſe,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, and beyond, and without all queſtion, they ſoon pull in their hornes, and think it beſt to diſtinguiſh, to cover the naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ſhame of their deniall. But alaſſe! the covering of the diſtinction is too ſcant and narrow for the ſervice, the nakedneſſe of the deniall appeares notwithſtanding. <hi>Of which latter ſort</hi> (ſay they, ſpeaking of thoſe who <hi>publiſh Doctrines hurtfull,</hi> as they are pleaſed to tearme them, <hi>to the peace of the Church and State) if any ſhould be conſcientious, the Ordinance is no wayes bent againſt their faces, as they are conſcientious, but as they are inſtruments of evill, &amp;c.</hi> But</p>
            <p>

Chriſt and his Apoſtles preaching the Goſpel, <hi>publiſhed Doctrines,</hi> that occaſioned diviſions and diſtractions both in Families and States, as we all know.

They were indeed <hi>hurtfull</hi> and interruptive, of, and to, that ſinfull peace wherein they found them; but they who publiſhed them, were never the more <hi>inſtruments of evill.</hi> In like manner if there be any agreement or <hi>peace in a Church or State,</hi> in any thing which is evill, or erroneous; they who ſhall <hi>publiſh Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines</hi> which may probably occaſion the diſturbance of ſuch peace (eſpecially as the degree of the evill, and nature of the error may be) are not therefore <hi>inſtruments of evill.</hi> But miſerable is the condition of that <hi>Church or State,</hi> which ſhall puniſh men, not onely <hi>truely conſcientious, but inſtruments alſo of good unto them,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the notion of <hi>inſtruments of evill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, I deſire to ingage the conſciences of theſe men, to<note place="margin">Sect. 77.</note> anſwer me to theſe foure Queſtions.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Whether they doe not look upon the <hi>publiſhing</hi> of the principles of the Congregationall Government (and ſo of that which they call Ana-Baptiſme) whether by way of Doctrine, or of practiſe, as the <hi>publiſhing of Doctrines hurtfull to the peace of the Church and State?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Whether they doe not judge the number of thoſe perſons amongſt us, who <hi>publiſh ſuch Doctrines</hi> as theſe, either by word, or practiſe, to be a very conſiderable number?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Whether they doe not judge farre the greateſt part of theſe men to be <hi>truely conſcientious?</hi> If they ſhall anſwer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatively (as I know their conſciences will, whatſoever them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves will doe) to all theſe Queſtions;</p>
            <p>I will (as to this point) crave but another Anſwer to this brief Queſtion, whether the Ordinance in debate <hi>be not bent againſt the faces of all theſe men?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Themſelves grant <hi>in terminis,</hi> that it is bent againſt ſuch, who (in their ſenſe, for ſo they muſt needs be underſtood) ſhall <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Doctrines that are hurtfull to the peace of the Church and State;</hi>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:159924:67"/>
yea, they grant by way of a cleer ſuppoſition, that there are of<note place="margin">Sect. 78</note> theſe who <hi>are conſcientious</hi> (if they ſhould not, their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences would not beare it at their hands) onely, they deny, that the Ordinance is <hi>bent against</hi> theſe men, <hi>AS they are conſcientious.</hi> Did ever the <hi>Dragon</hi> or the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> I mean <hi>Rome,</hi> either Pagan or Anti-Chriſtian, <hi>bend</hi> their bloody Edicts or perſecutions againſt the Saints, the moſt <hi>conſcientious</hi> men amongſt them, <hi>AS they were conſcientious?</hi> or in any other reſpect or conſideration whatſoever, then <hi>AS</hi> (in their ſenſe) <hi>inſtruments of evill?</hi> The moſt ungodly perſecuting wretch that ever breathed under theſe Heavens, did never perſecute or ſpeak evill of a Saint, <hi>AS</hi> a godly, or <hi>conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious</hi> man.

            <p>Whereas they ingage themſelves with ſo much diligence to<note place="margin">Sect. 78.</note> prove, that <hi>Laws muſt be bent againſt Inſtruments of evill, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding any conſcience they pretend to have;</hi> take knowledge, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that it is but a ſtale device to delude ſimple and inconſidering men; uſually practiſed by thoſe, who being not able to grapple with an Adverſary, in the point in queſtion between them, hunt counter and follow with great eagerneſſe and openneſſe of mouth a falſe ſent; laying on proofe upon proofe, reaſon upon reaſon to prove ſomething, which it may be hath ſome affinity, at leaſt in a ſound of words, with the Queſtion in hand, but was never denied, nor intended to be denied, by their oppoſer, nor indeed is any matter of controverſie between any; that by this meanes they may cover their weakneſſe and inſufficiency to deale with their Adverſary, from weak and injudicious men, and ſeem to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

The Counter-Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſts<note place="margin">Sect. 79</note> have taken this Sanctuary, once againe, and the third time alſo, in this their Vindication: and they doe it palpably in this place. For did the Queriſt ever deny, or intimate the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination in him towards a deniall, but that <hi>Lawes ought to bee bent</hi> againſt <hi>inſtruments of evill, notwithſtanding any conſcience they</hi> pretend <hi>to have.</hi> Therfore the labour which they beſtow in the proofe of this, they ſhould have done well to have converted ſome other way; and particularly, in ſeeking out a rock<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to build their High-Presbytery upon, which all this while ſtands upon ſandy and looſe foundations.</p>
            <p>That which they yet adde in the cloſe of this Anſwer, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Geneva, having Laws againſt Heretiques, &amp;c.</hi> neither reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the demand of the Querie, nor yet the import of their owne Argument, pretending legitimacy of deſcent from it, It is one thing for a State to have <hi>Laws againſt Heretiques;</hi> another, by Laws or Ordinances to ſtrike at great, and <hi>very conſiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the beſt and moſt conſcientious men amongſt them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>Secondly, This Anſwer advanceth with this Divinity; <hi>that within the generall ſcope of the Commandement, which is the obſerving of thoſe times, and thoſe onely as neceſſary to Religion, which God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe appoints, was included the Jewiſh Sabbath, or Saturday, before Chriſts Reſurrection, and the Chriſtian Sabbath, the Lords day, is now ſince Chriſts Reſurrection, included alſo.</hi> But</p>
            <p>Firſt, If the Jewiſh Sabbath <hi>was included in</hi> the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or in <hi>the ſcope of the Commandement, before Chriſts Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,</hi> how came it to be <hi>excluded</hi> after his <hi>Reſurrection?</hi> Hath the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of Chriſt any ſuch influence upon the morall Law, as to cauſe it to eject, or caſt out any thing formerly by way of duty contained <hi>or included in it?</hi>

            <p>Thirdly (and laſtly) doe theſe men ſubſtantially prove, that <hi>the morall Law contained in the ten Commandements, is the rule of a Chriſtians life,</hi> onely by ſaying, that <hi>the Chriſtian Sabbath, is now included in the generall ſcope of the fourth Commandement, and that the Sacraments of the New Teſtament, Baptiſme and the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, are included within the ſcope of the ſecond Commandement now?</hi> Firſt, they prove not ſo much as the leaſt haire of their heads a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount unto, of either of their aſſertions: and yet neither of them lyeth ſo neare any known principle either of Reaſon, or Religion, that they need have feared<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the proverbiall reproof of <hi>lighting up a candle to ſee the Sunne,</hi> in caſe they had beſtowed a ſlender argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or two, upon the clearing of them. But ſecondly, if what they affirme in both, were granted, yet their concluſion is not hereby gained. For onely ſuch a <hi>Law</hi> can properly be called <hi>a rule of life</hi> to Chriſtians, which either particularly, or at leaſt ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, preſcribes and regulates all things neceſſary to be done by a Chriſtian, as a Chriſtian. Now <hi>the generall ſcope</hi> of the two <hi>Commandements</hi> ſpecified, and much more the <hi>Commandements</hi> themſelves, are ſo farre, either from preſcribing, or regulating either of the duties reſpectively affirmed to be <hi>included</hi> in them, that without particular direction for the performance both of the one and the other, otherwiſe; neither of them had ever beene practiſed by men, notwithſtanding <hi>the generall ſcope of the ſaid Commandements,</hi> yea and Commandements themſelves.

               </gap>, which of the two was the ſenſe intended by the Ordinance?

            <p>Firſt, I wonder how theſe men come to know, or to preſume what the Parliaments ſenſe is about that <hi>Free-will.</hi> which is ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced with impriſonment in the <hi>Ordinance,</hi> when as (confident I am) that they have never yet given an account of their ſenſe therein, either unto them, or any other.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I would willingly ask theſe men, what competent grounds they have, to think (eſpecially with ſo much confidence as their words import) that either the Parliament, or eſpecially the makers of the Ordinance, mean, <hi>the Arminian Free-will;</hi> when as, firſt, it is probable, that they never ſtudied the ſtate of the Controverſie between the <hi>Arminians</hi> and their oppoſers, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

            <p>Thirdly, I deſire of them, that they will pleaſe in their Rejoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to relieve my darkneſſe in the point with their light, and clearly informe me, what themſelves mean by the <hi>Arminian Free will.</hi> I have beſtowed ſome time, and upon occaſion inquired as narrowly as ſome others, to finde out what was the ſenſe and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of <hi>Arminius</hi> himſelf, about the bondage, and <hi>freedome</hi> of the <hi>will:</hi> I have likewiſe conſulted the writings of ſome that are generally reputed his followers, upon the ſame occaſion. By comparing the Maſter with ſome of his Diſciples, I clearly finde that there is to the full as great a difference between the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the one and of the other (in the point now under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration) as there is between the judgement of the generality of learned Divines in <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Arminius</hi> himſelf.

Amongſt ſome of <hi>Arminius</hi> followers I confeſſe I found it otherwiſe. Now then this is the requeſt which I make to theſe men (and I truſt they will not judge it unreaſonable) that they will plainly declare themſelves what they mean by their <hi>Arminian Freewill;</hi> whether that, which is held and taught by <hi>Arminius</hi> himſelfe, or which is maintained by ſome of his followers; there being ſo materiall and conſiderable a difference between them?</p>
            <p>Fourthly (and laſtly) whereas they ſend us to the <hi>generality of</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sect. 86.</note> 
               <hi>the Reformed Churches</hi> to informe our ſelves, what <hi>Free-will</hi> it is, which is made puniſhable by the Ordinance with impriſonment, defining it to be that, <hi>which by the Reformed Churches is generally

condemned as a pernicious Errour.</hi> Firſt, I cannot but judge it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable<note place="margin">Sect. 87</note> in the higheſt, that the generality of men amongſt us ſhould be made obnoxious to impriſonment, by ſuch an expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in an Ordinance or Law, the ſenſe and meaning whereof they cannot come to underſtand, but onely by conſulting the writings and all the confeſſions of Faith, ſet forth by all the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches</hi> reſpectively. Alas, the farre greater number of men amongſt us, are wholy uncapable of this information, not underſtanding the language, wherein theſe Confeſſions of Faith are written.</p>
            <p>Secondly, To my knowledge the Reformed Churches them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves do not <hi>generally,</hi> at leaſt not univerſally agree, in condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>the Arminian free-will,</hi> as <hi>a pernicious Errour,</hi> but ſome of them doe ſubſcribe and publiſh that to the world upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject for truth, which others of them condemne for an Errour. So that the Anti-Queriſts have meerly baffled in their Anſwer, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of giving any ſatisfaction to the Querie, demanding the ſenſe of this clauſe in the Ordinance, <hi>that a man by nature hath free-will to turne unto God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In their 26 and 27 Anſwer, <hi>pag.</hi> 29. though they quit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves<note place="margin">Sect. 87.</note> with ſomewhat more fairneſſe and ingenuity, then they do in all the reſt, yet they do not ſpeak diſtinctly enough to the minde of the Querie, when by <hi>Blaſpheming,</hi> in the Ordinance, they ſay, are meant, <hi>onely ſuch horrible expreſſions againſt God, as cannot with patience be heard by any Chriſtian eare.</hi> In this deſcription, there are ſundry particulars of a very doubtfull interpretation. As firſt, when they define, <hi>Blaſphemy,</hi> by <hi>horrible expeſſions againſt God,</hi> whether they exclude <hi>Chriſt</hi> man, or as being man, from being an object capable of this Blaſphemy. Secondly, what they mean by a <hi>Chriſtian ear;</hi> whether the ear of a perſon, who is <hi>Chriſtian</hi> indeed, <hi>i. e.</hi> a true and ſound Believer, or of a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> at large, and by outward pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ſſion onely. We know there is a great difference between the <hi>eare</hi> of the one, and of the other, in reſpect of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting <hi>Blaſphemy.</hi> If they meane the <hi>eare</hi> of a ſound <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> a true Beleever, it is a point of no eaſie deciſion to determine, who amongſt men are ſuch. If the <hi>eare</hi> of a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> at large, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they cannot but know, that there are many ſuch <hi>eares,</hi> who can heare any <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> whatſoever, <hi>with patience</hi> (whatſoever is
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:159924:71"/>
meant by it) more then enough. Thirdly and laſtly, what they<note place="margin">Sect. 88.</note> meane, <hi>by being heard with patience,</hi> whether by <hi>Patience,</hi> they mean ſuch a compoſedneſſe of minde and ſpirit, which keepes men from all unſeemly deportment or expreſſion of themſelves out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, in caſes of provocation: (which is the common ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the word) or elſe ſuch a temper, by which a man is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed to greeve, or take ſorrow upon ſuch occaſions, which uſually cauſe ſorrow and griefe of heart unto men. Stand we by, either the one ſignification of the word, <hi>Patience,</hi> or the other, the clauſe, <hi>cannot be heard with pat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>nce,</hi> will be found very incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to be put into the definition, or deſcription of <hi>Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</hi> If we ſtand by the former, certaine it is, that the <hi>more Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian the eare</hi> is, the greater <hi>Blaſphemy will be heard with patience.</hi> The ſtronger and better built any Chriſtian is, the further he will be from any unſeemly carrage upon any provocation whatſoever. If by the latter, the ſenſe is altogether uncouth, and no meat ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the <hi>eare,</hi> or underſtanding.</p>
            <p>Of like ambiguity, and incumbred with the ſame difficulties, is their explication of this clauſe in the Ordinance, <hi>impugning the word of God; this</hi> (they ſay) <hi>cannot reaſonably <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But ſuppoſe theſe men ſhould give us a cleer and a faire ſenſe of theſe, and all other expreſſions in the Ordinance, that are dark and dubious, yet this would not juſtifie the Ordinance, unleſſe the makers and contrivers of it will pleaſe to ratifie them with their ſubſcriptions.

               </note> ſecondly they affirme, that it may be made <hi>puniſhable</hi> notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. The reaſon they give, is onely this; becauſe <hi>in another ſenſe</hi> (which they call <hi>the literall, and common) it is a dangerous and pernicious error.</hi> But will any man Chriſtianly diſpoſed, judge it meet, that the ſaying or publiſhing, that <hi>Christ is a Vine, or a doore,</hi> ſhould be made puniſhable; unleſſe they declare the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularity of that ſenſe, wherein they make it puniſhable. But this light courteſie cannot (it ſeemes) be obtained in the caſe of <hi>Gods ſeeing no ſin in the juſtified,</hi> of thoſe, who yet would have the world beleeve, that they have ſufficiently Anſwered the Queries.</p>
            <p>Before they come to Syllogize the twenty ninth Querie, they<note place="margin">Sect. 89.</note> make a ſad complaint of it, that <hi>it is perplexed, and the ſenſe of it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved, &amp;c.</hi> But I marvell why they ſhould turne Queruliſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Queriſt upon occaſion of this Query, when as in their Anſwer to it (ſetting aſide a gentle evaporation of ſome folly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the beginning of it, and a little fit of frowardneſſe in the end) they are more diſtinct, and ſpeake more ſteadily to the heart of it, then they doe to any of the reſt in their reſpective Anſwers; yea they have not quitted themſelves ſo like men of judgement and underſtanding in all their diſcourſe beſides, as they have done in the ſober part of this Anſwer; which (for their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit) I ſhall ſet downe in their owne words, and improve a little for their benefit. <hi>He</hi> (ſay they) <hi>that hath read the Socinian bookes, whoſe proper opinion it is, that a man must beleeve no more, then by his reaſon he can comprehend, will eaſily be ſatisfied, that the Ordinance plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly requireth, that a man ſhould not refuſe to beleeve thoſe Doctrines, which are clearly, and certainly, for the matter of them, laid downe in the word of God; as for example, the Doctrine of the Trinity, and the incarnation of the Son of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> although for the manner of them he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not by his reaſon comprehend them, and NOT THAT A MAM M<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ST BELEEVE THAT WHICH HE HATH NO REASON OR GRO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ND FOR IN THE WORD OF GOD.</hi> So then they clearly, and fairly grant, that the Ordinance <hi>doth not require, that a man muſt</hi> [or ought] in point of Religion, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve</hi> any thing, but what <hi>he hath reaſon and ground for, in the word of God.</hi> From hence then it follows</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:159924:72"/>Firſt, that Reaſon ought to be every mans leader, Guide, and<note place="margin">Sect. 90</note>

This is ſound Divinity indeed: and few more ſuch principles as this, well digeſted by theſe men and their friends, would make them worthy of that title of honour which they ſo much affect, I meane, <hi>Orthodox.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, From the ſaid Grant it followeth alſo, that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ought not to require their people, to beleeve any thing (much leſſe every thing) which they teach, unleſſe they have <hi>a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and ground</hi> for it (and thoſe ſufficient, for <hi>mortuus hon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Thirdly, it followeth yet further, that neither ought men to receive or ſubſcribe unto with the hand of their Faith, the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations or Decretalls of Synods, Councils, or Aſſemblies of perſons of what capacity or worth ſoever, in matters of Religion, unleſſe they have a ſufficient <hi>Reaſon or ground</hi> from <hi>the word of God,</hi> for what they doe receive in this kinde.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, and laſtly it followeth yet once more from the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid grant, that men ought to make uſe of, yea, and ingage to the uttermoſt, their Reaſons or their diſcurſive abilities, in all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith and Religion whatſoever; and not to ſwallow any thing by a looſe credulity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but to look narrowly upon every thing with the eye of Reaſon, before they receive it by the hand of Faith. All theſe deductions are of a legitimate and cleere deſcent from the mentioned grant, and are all of them pregnant, noble<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and magnifique Truths.

               </gap>, for the <hi>oppoſition</hi> they ſpeake of between the two Governments. I cannot believe that any perſon, man, or woman, Congregationally inclined, did ever either perſwade any of the <hi>Miniſters</hi> they ſpeake of, <hi>to oppoſe that Government by Presbytery, which is establiſhed by the Parliament;</hi> nor yet diſtill into them any of that ſpirit, or thoſe principles, out of which they oppoſe it. How then ſhould they be acceſſary to the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition?</p>
            <p>Secondly, whereas they charge the friends of the Queriſts yet further, with <hi>endeavouring to binde heavy burthens upon others, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver perſecuting them for not yeelding to, &amp;c.</hi> this is tidings, yet ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven degrees ſtranger then the other.

            <p>Thirdly.

themſelves, then eaſed or relieved by their unjuſt preſſures.<note place="margin">Sect. 94.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, I am yet farre more deſirous to know, what <hi>perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,</hi> they, or any of their judgement, have ſuffered from In de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents, <hi>for not yeeding to thoſe things, which even the conſciences of thoſe that preſſe them, know they cannot, and believe they may not, yeeld unto.</hi> If they ſhall referre me for ſatisfaction herein to that which follows in the ſequel of this anſwer, where they ſpeak of ſome, <hi>who, under the name of Brethren, that have ſo much cryed out againſt perſecution in their words and writings, have yet attempted and proceeded in the ſtrangest perſecution that ever was amongſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Chriſtians, to wiſh and joy in the impoſition of that upon their Brethren, which themſelves, who are for the impoſition of it, yet count unlawfull to be ſubmitted unto;</hi> I muſt profeſſe that I am ſo farre from receiving ſatisfaction hereby in the leaſt, in reference to that deſire, that I look upon the reference, as a ſending of me from the twilight to midnight, to read a dim print; or as an unworthy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting over my petition, in giving me a <hi>ſtone,</hi> inſtead of the <hi>bread</hi> which I defired. But.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Though the <hi>perſecution</hi> they here ſpeak of, be, as they ſay,<note place="margin">Sect. 94.</note> 
               <hi>very ſtrange,</hi> yea, as I ſay, yet more <hi>ſtrange,</hi> then as they preſent it; ſo <hi>ſtrange,</hi> that I believe it was never yet <hi>attempted,</hi> neither in theſe daies, nor in the daies of any of their forefathers, <hi>amongſt</hi> the men they ſpeak of, <hi>profeſſed Chriſtians;</hi> yet is it not of that devouring or fiery calculation, of which many of thoſe perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are, which are daily breathed forth by the lips and pens of many of their Intereſt, againſt thoſe who wiſh them no harm. But</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is not a little <hi>ſtrange</hi> to me, that they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent that as a perſecution ſo <hi>STRANGE, as never yet at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted among profeſſed Chriſtians,</hi> when as themſelves (if it be <hi>perſecution</hi>) have <hi>attempted,</hi> yea, and practiſed it in this very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. For doe they not in their Anſwer to the ſecond Querie, p. 6. impoſe it upon, yea and ſolemnly charge (which is more then to <hi>wiſh</hi>) the Queriſts <hi>own Church or Congregation, as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the honour of God, and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the Authority of the Spirit, by which the Holy Apostle delivered thoſe fore-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Anathema's, that they put him away from among them, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him to Satan?</hi> and yet doe they not withall judge it utterly
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:159924:74"/>
unlawfull, for the members of a particular <hi>Church or Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sect. 95</note> to exerciſe authority over their Paſtour, or to proceed to a ſentence of excommunication, eſpecially, againſt the cheife of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer, by and of themſelves? Therefore, if <hi>to wiſh or joy in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of that upon their Brethren, which themſelves, who are for the impoſition of it, yet count unlawfull to be ſubmitted unto, be ſo ſtrange a perſecution,</hi> as they render it; certainly themſelves, and thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands more of their friends, are the ſtrangeſt perſecutours (and that with the ſtrangeſt <hi>perſecution</hi>) that ever were. For what <hi>joy anh ſtamping with the foot</hi> hath there been amongſt the children of high-Presbytery, for this Anſwer to the Queries, (as empty as it is) and more emphatically, for the ſhameleſſe piece of outrage, committed in that part of this Anſwer, which relates to the ſecond Querie, where the ſayd <hi>ſtrange perſecution</hi> is ſo vigorouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acted.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Till theſe men ſhall make due proofe, that that<note place="margin">Sect. 95.</note> 
               <hi>ſtrange perſecution</hi> they ſpeake of, hath been indeed <hi>attempted and proceeded in</hi> by perſons intereſſed in judgement for the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall way; I muſt looke upon the report and charge (and ſhall deſire others alſo to looke upon them with the ſame eye) as <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> look'd upon the contents of <hi>Sanballats</hi> letter, to which he returned this anſwer. <hi>There are no ſuch things done as thou ſdyeſt, but thou fainest them out of thine own heart</hi>

            <p>Fourthly, Whereas they ſay and grant in Anſwer to this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, that <hi>Presbyteriall Government in the Ordirance, muſt needs ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie that which it doth in other Ordinances of Parliament, that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which the Parliament hath begun to ſettle,</hi> (and conſequently, it cannot ſignifie <hi>that Government</hi> by Presbytery ſo importunely deſired by the Miniſters, there being ſo unpleaſing a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them) they anſwer (I confeſſe) with ſome ingenuitie, and that which may doe good ſervice.</p>
            <p>Fiftly and laſtly, when they further ſay, that <hi>the Government ſetled by the Parliament, is not of that kinde they</hi> (the Queriſts friends, they mean, Independents) <hi>would have it,</hi> themſelves fairly take

            <p>Thirdly, The place in the Pſalme, is more generally underſtood in a metaphoricall ſenſe, by expoſitors; and doubtleſſe was no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe cited, or applyed by our Saviour here, <hi>viz.</hi> then as a Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture holding forth and atteſting this providentiall method, courſe, and practiſe of God; to make the meaneſt and weakeſt of his creatures, bountifull contributors unto his praiſe and glory, Fourthly, (and laſtly for this) in caſe God ſhould deſire extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary praiſe and glory from <hi>children</hi> not yet <hi>capable of Inſtruction, or learning how to pray,</hi> the officiouſneſſe of men in attempting to <hi>teach them how to pray,</hi> would rather be injurious unto, then any wayes comporting with, this his deſire.

            <p>Secondly, Suppoſe <hi>the Scriptures be cleer enough to warrant the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of theſe men,</hi> to hold themſelves with the Ordinance in the points and doctrines countenanced therein; yet what <hi>cleerneſſe</hi> have they in theſe, more then darkneſſe it ſelf, <hi>to warrant them in the puniſhing of thoſe,</hi> who are contrary-minded unto them, eſpecially in ſome of theſe?

            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, When they expreſſe themſelves indefinitely, thus; <hi>cleerly enough, to warrant the conſciences of thoſe that are inſtructed in thoſe Doctrines, to puniſh thoſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c.</hi> do they intend to intereſſe all their proſelytes, tagge and ragge, without exception, when once they have imparted the Doctrines of the Ordinance unto them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in a warrantableneſſe of power, <hi>to puniſh thoſe that perſiſt to publiſh any thing contrary to them?</hi> Doe they <hi>warrant the conſciences</hi> of the prophane and rude multitude to become their auxiliaries in perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting and moleſting their conſcientious Brethren?</p>
            <p>Fourthly, whereas they determine, that <hi>in every point, whether</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sect. 105.</note> 
               <hi>cleerly, or not cleerly, determined, mens being already ingaged in the Truth, doth not make them unmeet, but rather more meet to be judges in ſuch caſes</hi> (viz. then thoſe, who as yet ſtand undeclared; for ſo the Querie) no conſidering man (I ſuppoſe) can concurre with them in their determination. The end of judging and deciding contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted opinions in Religion between party and party, being firſt the uniting of their judgements; and ſecondly, (if it may be) the uniting them in the Truth; evident it is, that thoſe who are looked upon by one of the parties, as profeſſed enemies to their judgement, and ingaged on the contrary ſide, are like to prove but mediatours of ſmall value to comprimize between them, and thoſe who diſſent in judgement from them. Their very ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the contrary ſide, cannot in reaſon but be looked upon as a very great diſadvantage to what they ſhall ſpeake or argue, be it for the Truth. Topicall arguments from a friend, or a perſon no wayes ingaged or declared againſt men, are wont to go further, and to doe more in ſwaying the judgements of men, then ſeven demonſtrations from a profeſſed and known enemy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:159924:80"/>Fifthly, and laſtly; whereas they yet adde<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that <hi>if they be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Magiſtrates, who are already ingaged for the Truth, they have Authority from God to appoint ſubordinate Judges, viz. ſuch who are alſo already ingaged in the ſame Truth;</hi> Firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I deſire to know, for what end theſe <hi>ſubordinate Judges</hi> ſhould be appointed? what ſhall their work or imployment be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Onely to tell men with Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and power, and an iron Scepter in their hand, that they are the men that are Orthodox and know the Truth; and to give ſentence of impriſonment, death, or the like<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> againſt all thoſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who will not think as honourably of them, as they doe of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? The truth is, that all the work and ſervice that ſuch Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges can doe by vertue of this their deputation, being truely inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted, amounts to no more.

to civill Magiſtrates or others, either in the Old or New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to make an Expoſition of any clauſe in the Law, controverted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween men of equall worth, a matter puniſhable with impriſonment or death.</hi> This propoſition (ſay they) <hi>is not true:</hi> but have they not ſaid it to the ſhame and confuſion of their pens for ever? or can they finde a fourth man under Heaven, that is poſſeſt but of the ordinary intereſt of a man, willing to venture his reputation with theirs, in ſuch a craſie bottome, as this? But let us ſee how and with what coards, they under-gird their veſſell, for feare of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in pieces.</p>
            <p>Firſt, they ſay, <hi>the minor is not true; unleſſe any man can prove, that there neither is, nor ever was, any authority in any Civill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate (for if not in them, then in no others) in any matter of Religion.</hi> But,</p>
            <p>Firſt, doth the truth of any one propoſition, depend upon any mans ability, to prove another to be true? Certainly, the <hi>minor,</hi> which they deny, may be <hi>true,</hi> though no man can <hi>prove,</hi> either that which they propoſe, or any other propoſition whatſoever. The <hi>truth</hi> of propoſitions is independent; though the manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or proofe of this truth, be not.</p>
            <p>Secondly, what truth, or colour of Truth, is there in that hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theticall; <hi>If not in them, then in no others.</hi> Was there no <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> in the Apoſtles about <hi>matters of Religion?</hi> or <hi>were they Civill Magiſtrates?</hi> Or if their meaning be, that in caſe <hi>Magiſtrates have no Authority in matters of Religion,</hi> then have they none in <hi>other</hi> matters; the connexion is ſtill as looſe and wilde as before; and not ſo much as an eye of a conſequence in it. There is every whit as much ſenſe and reaſon in this: If a man hath no gold, he hath no ſilver: Or in this, If a man hath not foure legges, he hath not two. But let us goe on with them, and ſee how they prove the neceſſity of proving that which they propoſe, to prove their <hi>minor</hi> untrue.</p>

               </hi> (but none, as hath been proved, ſufficient to prove) <hi>that the ſame Authority belongs to the Civill Magiſtrate under the New Teſtament: which is alſo generally exprest by Divines under that phraſe of being</hi> Cuſtos, <hi>the Guardian of both the Tables of Gods Law; and by the Prophet</hi> (Eſai. 49. Eſai. 60.) <hi>under thoſe phraſes of being Nurſing Fathers to the Church, and bringing in their glory to it; which muſt needs imply uſing their Authority to ſuppreſſe th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It hath lived hitherto full of affection to the cauſe of high Presbytery; but hath ſpoken weakly for it. So now it dies, without any declining in the one, or raiſing it ſelf up in the other. But</p>
            <p>Firſt, what the meaning of <hi>Divines</hi> is, in that <hi>gener all expreſſion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sect. 109.</note> 
               <hi>The Civill Magiſtrate is</hi> Cuſtos utriuſque Tabulae, the keeper of both Tables, I confeſſe I doe not well underſtand. If it had been the ſaying of an Apoſtle, I ſhould (I conceive) have judged my ſelf under a deeper ingagement, to make a diſtrict inquiry into it, then now I doe. The richeſt and beſt ſenſe of the ſaying, that I know, is this: <hi>The Civill Magiſtrate is the keeper of Both Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles;</hi> that is, is in ſpeciall manner obliged, by vertue of his Office and High Place of dignity amongſt men, whereunto God hath
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:159924:84"/>
called him, to be a diligent and exemplary obſerver and doer of the whole will of God; contained in <hi>both the Tables of his Law.</hi> In ſuch a phraſe or figure of ſpeech as this ſenſe repreſents the ſaying in, the Apoſtle ſaith concerning the Magiſtrate we ſpeak of, that <hi>he is the Miniſter of God unto thee for good. He is,</hi> that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, by the ingagement of his place and Office, he ought to be <hi>a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of God unto thee, for thy good,</hi> Rom. 13. 4.</p>
            <p>Another ſenſe in goodneſſe not much inferiour to the former, is this: <hi>The Civill Magiſtrate is the keeper of, &amp;c.</hi> that is, is bound by the tenure of his place and Dignity, to provide (above the rate of other men) by all meanes authorized by God, that all du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties commanded, either in the <hi>firſt</hi> or <hi>ſecond Table,</hi> be performed by all under his juriſdiction. This (I conceive) is moſt likely to be the ſence, wherein Divines and others ſo frequently uſe the ſaying. But this ſence imports neither duty upon, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> power in this <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> to compell men by the ſword to be of his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion (though he be never ſo confident that his Religion is true, and the beſt that is, to be imbraced by men) but only upon this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition (which with all the artificiall dreſſing and colouring that hath been beſtowed upon it, could never yet be made to look like a Truth) <hi>viz.</hi> that men really conſcientious in their way, and peaceable, may contrary to their conſcience, be forced into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, by the materiall ſword. The Magiſtrate is bound by all lawfull meanes whatſoever to procure the <hi>obſervation of both the Tables,</hi> and to guard every precept in them both, againſt all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience and contempt from men; but he is not bound to doe ſo much, as the leaſt haire on his head amounts unto, in any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous way, though by it he might hope to purchaſe the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect obſervation of all things commanded in both Tables, by men unto the worlds end.</p>
            <p>Secondly, whereas they ſeek for that bloody Authority which they ſo much deſire to veſt in the Civill Magiſtrate, in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and think they have found it in thoſe expreſſions, wherein he propheſies that <hi>Kings ſhall be Nurſing Fathers unto the Church, and ſhall bring their glory to it;</hi> I Anſwer.</p>

Yea, the Prophet hmiſelfe explaines his prophecie of <hi>Kings being nurſing Fathers unto the Church,</hi> according to the tenour of this expoſition. <hi>Thou ſhalt alſo</hi> (ſpeaking unto the Church) <hi>ſucke the milke of the Gentiles, and ſhalt ſucke the breſt of Kings, &amp;c.</hi> Eſa. 60. 16.

            <p>Secondly, For that other expreſſion, <hi>and ſhall bring their glory to it</hi> (if it were to be found in this Prophecy, as I believe it is not) this is more a ſtranger to their purpoſe then the former.

Church? There is (I grant) ſuch an expreſſion in the booke of the Revelation <note n="*" place="margin">Revel. 21. 24. 26.</note>; but evident it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is (by comparing this place with <hi>Eſa</hi> 60. throughout) that by that <hi>glory,</hi> which the <hi>Kings of the Gentiles</hi> ſhall <hi>bring</hi> unto the Church, is meant nothing elſe but their <hi>wealth and riches;</hi> which are called a mans honour, or <hi>glory,</hi> Gen. 31. 1. <hi>And of that which was our Fathers, hath he gotten all this glory.</hi> Yea, the Expoſition is made by the Holy Ghoſt himſelf, Eſa. 61. 6. <hi>Ye ſhall eate the riches of the Gentiles, and in their glory ſhall ye b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
